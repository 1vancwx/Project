The successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, JWST is NASA's flagship astrophysics mission in collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). It will provide improved infrared resolution and sensitivity over Hubble and enable a broad range of investigations across the fields of astronomy and cosmology, including observing some of the most distant events and objects in the universe. The telescope will orbit the Sun at the [second Earth-Sun Lagrange point (L2)](https://webb.nasa.gov/content/about/orbit.html) approximately 1.5 million kilometers away from the Earth.

**Watch the launch broadcast beginning at 6:00am EST on** [**NASA TV**](https://www.nasa.gov/nasalive/)**. The** [**Spanish broadcast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlDQCmwGM5g) **begins at 6:30am EST.**
