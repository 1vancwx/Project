This is my first attempt at a DD, so be easy on me, but please poke holes into my DD and lets have discussion as to why this will be the next 10 bagger.

I'm sure you're tired about hearing about the latest squeeze plays and they never turn out. This is different and I'll tell you why in the following DD. I want all of us to make money on this, if you believe you'll make money going short feel free. I'll be on the other end of the trade collecting your tendies.

# What is Grab?

I will clarify that this play is an active SPAC which some of you may have been involved with when the deal required more time for Grab to get the required financials submitted to the SEC. In fact this is one of the largest SPAC's in the world with a 40b valuation. The CEO stated the merger will be completed in Q4-2021. The following preliminary proxy was submitted on 10-18-2021, so we aren't far from the final proxy.

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001855612/000119312521300606/d496451df4a.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001855612/000119312521300606/d496451df4a.htm)

If you've ever taken a ride share in South Asia it was probably through a Grab. It's a great experience all around. However, Grab isn't just a ride-share company, they are a super app, fintech, food delivery, vaccine deliver, and more. Below is the the corporate structure of Grab. This is also a US company merging with a S. Asia company. However, you can view the investors presentation on grab below the company structure.

# Why a SPAC/un-SPAC?:

AGC's CEO is Brad Gerstner a VC, who wanted to do a SPAC because of the broken process in place for IPOs, really it's an un-SPAC trying to build a better IPO. I suggest listening to his reasoning of doing a SPAC deal.

# Floats, Shares, and SIs

I'm going to steal the write up on the float from [u/Lawlpaper](https://www.reddit.com/u/Lawlpaper/) as he did a wonderful job at [r/Shortsqueeze](https://www.reddit.com/r/Shortsqueeze/), you can view his original, which will be more entertaining than mine, I did use my charts instead and included additional data.

What are **floats**? Yeah it's school time because most of you just see someone yell something with rockets and you buy it. You forget to check the SNDL has literal **billions** of shares outstanding. Compare that to GME and why it worked so well, GME has 54**million** during its first squeeze.

Floats are just shares we consider easily sold. **Free Float** they call them. Insiders cannot trade on insider knowledge. Those are called closely held shares. Institutions can trade as they like, but mostly are considered long for both their financial stability to do so, and for tax reasons. They also cant just buy and sell constantly like a day trader as they need to report those. So we are left with the float. Basically, retail and hedge funds that aren't **locked**.

**Locked**? Yes there are locked up shares that cannot be traded no matter what. Those are really important because you know for a fact that they cannot take a dump on you. PROG is living in this alternate reality currently. But we know the date that ends.

# How does this apply to AGC?

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q6lmlqvj1jw71.jpg?width=677&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=150de5c531bfd71eaa6d234c4a082ff9ab3faf46

Since floats are estimates, its hard to figure out what's going on with a normal publicly traded company. That's why we rely on smart people to figure out SPACs and newly deSPACs. Take |RNT for instance. This became a play, and even more so recently.. *yes I sold right before the market closed...* because we figured out that only 25% of the shares were tradable. Here's some numbers for you.

62 million total outstanding shares.

50 million is the number Fintel puts the float. Lazily might I add.

19.2 million minus Institutions.

7.2 million minus everything except the public.

12 million a figure calculated by taking into account that about 80% of the shareholders are known to be holding through the merger for long term.

I'll convince you later why it's really about 87% of the shares will not be traded.

So we got a float, so what?

12 million shares sounds like a **very small floa**t, no? You'd be right, look at the volume over the last week compared to the price action. It's moving easily with some low volume.

# AGC in the past week

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3wz5jnfq1jw71.jpg?width=1553&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8638f919eb1fb1b7035de18b1dfdc3a1e66fc1b

Let it be known, that all of those spike you see, happened with less than a million shares traded. Yeah. 12million float sounds about right.

Can we take into account that over the last week AGC has not stopped going up once?! uh YEAH. It has its ups and downs, like any other small float, but it has been rising steadily.

HEREs THE KICKER - There's 17-19million shares sold short.

We are talking 30% of the TOTAL outstanding shares, and up to 158% of the float by many counts.

158%

Now if you are one of [u/Lawlpaper](https://www.reddit.com/u/Lawlpaper/) followers, you know that he's been preaching 140%. This is because he's been watching the in and outward flow and believes we are sitting at about 17million shorts.

# So, why do the shorts need to cover?

# Any price above the red line is 17million shorts underwater

Look at that graph. That's the last month, he's watched the returned shares, and they haven't returned anything almost. Judging by the previous price, as well as the FTDs we know that all those shorts are underwater:

Now not every failure to deliver is going to be short, some may be longs, but look at the latest data from the SEC.

Also, take note on the daily chart above you'll notice that the institutions are shorting AGC early morning and slowly attempting to cover throughout the day bringing the price back up above where it was. If you pay attention it continues to do a cup pattern, very similar to what ß.KKT did.

Also, look at the yearly when the merger was first announced we are at more consistent volume now than it was back then.

We know that 17million shorts that were added before October 15th are now **ALL** underwater. Volume alone could push margin calls. But you know what else could push margin calls?

The setup is looking great for the next upward trend which could be very soon.

As of 10-28 according to the [financeheadline.com](https://financeheadline.com/) we are ranked 12 on the short squeeze candidate. The fee is low, but that doesn't mean it will stay low.

# The Merger:

What is different with AGC / Grab than the other short squeezes that you may have failed on? Grab isn't a crap company and as I mentioned above at a 40b valuation you'll be holding something of value. This is the largest SPAC deal in the world by 10 fold.

***Here's some tidbits you didn't know shared by*** [u/Lawlpaper](https://www.reddit.com/u/Lawlpaper/) ***.***

Brokers do not like mergers when it comes to shorts. When a ticker that they loaned is announced to cease to exist through a merger, **they want that share back**. Why? Because they must deliver the new share to the original owner at some point, or at least want theirs back. This isn't the same as Toys r Us where once the tickers ceases to exist you don't owe anyone anything. This share needs to be accounted for.

You can imagine loaning out a share that someone sold, and now knowing that you need either that share back, or a share of the new company. It's much easier and less risky to just get the original share back.

This is why many brokers have **terms** when it comes to tickers that are merging, and no longer to exist. The brokerage will actually **set a date** on which you must cover your short position and return the share. If you've ever been short on a company, **not a put**, that goes through a merger you know this because you got an email with that **date**. The date can be before the merger, or immediately after where you have to buy the new company.

Here's the candy in the pudding, all shorts must be done with **margin accounts**. Margin isn't just money, its any borrowing. This means that your brokerage **can and will** margin call you on the date if you fail to deliver.

# Recap:

87% of shares are closely held, not trading.

12mil float

140-158% SI best case

30% SI literal worst case.

We are averaging about 2-3m shares a day now and growing.

There WILL be covering, how much? depends on the brokers.

This isn't a case of only AGC squeezing, once the merger goes into effect Grab will be a spectacular investment. Grab is an amazing company with tremendous value. They not only provide Ride-shade, food delivery, fintech, vaccine delivery, but they're entering the healthcare market soon. Picture Uber, Grub-hub, Paypal, Sofi, and Clov all under one company known for being a super app! The early investors get better perks than us retail with the deal, but they are locked up.

# PIPE my dreams away.. (taken from [u/Lawlpaper](https://www.reddit.com/u/Lawlpaper/) once again)

We all have seen it. Short a new deSPAC. Don't hold through the merger!

Wanna know how serious the investors in AGC and Grab are? The shares are locked up for 3 Years..... **3 mother effing years.** Never before seen in an SPAC. This is some serious belief that GRAB will be worth far more than 40B by 3 years, and they believe there is no need to sell between then. **ONLY UP FROM HERE.** This company is turning out 50%-100%+ revenues each quarter. An absolute machine. The best part? It's all in emerging markets. Asia is growing, and this company will too with it.

**So lets talk the worst case, of the worst case possible:**

&gt;We're wrong, and brokers will let shorts ride through the merger, and not even require them to cover, just giving IOUs to the real share holder and saying ""eff it, who cares if we lent it to them, they sold at $10 and now its most likely going to be $40 in a few months."" Worst case scenario, you end up going up something like 300% in a year. So sorry for your gain.

Let's get this straight. That's not going to happen. Shorts will cover because this isn't ever coming down, and if it does, it wont be for 3 years. They'll get margin called long before then.

But why is there even shorts to begin with?

Good question. We ask that a lot around here. Why double down when retail has pushed it up 300%? Greed. All the delivery services and ride hailing companies got destroyed by COVID. Perfect time to short. What better than to short an SPAC which wall street hates, and one in particular that will probably fall through. They even pushed the merger back, which emboldened the shorts to double down. This was their thought process, I mean, *""Grab had a slowdown, will they even make it through COVID?!""*

LOL, not only did they make it through, they posted another +65% revenue, but during COVID they made themselves more valuable than gold. They expanded their food delivery service, started up their fintech, started expanding their health insurance, and even started a service to deliver vaccines for governments. They drove people for free to get vaccines and COVID tests. Talk about marketing.

The merger is on, expect news like §P®T on October 6th, when it took a 1600% ride over the next couple of weeks.

Grab is situated to go big, really big. Expect $60-$80 in the next couple of years. Which is why, the 17million shorts that sold at $10 will never see their money again. They will cut their losses here soon, or take even bigger ones later.

This is the ground floor.

**The good news, and your TL;DR, Shorts are screwed, and your portfolio will be up if I'm wrong or right.**

*Disclosure: ""AGC DD and why you cannot lose"" is based on not selling for a loss. As with any squeeze there is implied volatility, and this is in no way financial advice.*

A common question. Outstanding shares, PT, and Merger Date.

The rumor going around is between November 1st and the second week of November the deal will be finalized. However, that is just a rumor...  Above you can see the preliminary proxy was filed on 10-18-21, so they are close to closing the deal. I'd be safe and go with calls 12-17 or 1-2022 instead of the Nov 19th calls. This is not financial advice only a mere gamblers advice.

The new company will have the following outstanding shares.

&amp;#x200B;

With the 40B valuation, we are looking at an IPO price of $20 - $52. That's just the price target. We can go under, or over. DASH's IPO was $102, and not even a year later is $200. That just tells us that even if it ends up with 3B shares, we too would see a fundamental rise to at least $40 before the end of 2022. But let me reiterate, GRAB is going to be a juggernaut of a company. Imagine SQ when it IPO'd, $9 per share. GRAB has that kind of upwards availability in their business.",AGC The Inevitable 10 Bagger,2,1,"AGC The Inevitable 10 Bagger # AGC / Grab Merger The Inevitable 10 Bagger

This is my first attempt at a DD, so be easy on me, but please poke holes into my DD and lets have discussion as to why this will be the next 10 bagger.

I'm sure you're tired about hearing about the latest squeeze plays and they never turn out. This is different and I'll tell you why in the following DD. I want all of us to make money on this, if you believe you'll make money going short feel free. I'll be on the other end of the trade collecting your tendies.

# What is Grab?

I will clarify that this play is an active SPAC which some of you may have been involved with when the deal required more time for Grab to get the required financials submitted to the SEC. In fact this is one of the largest SPAC's in the world with a 40b valuation. The CEO stated the merger will be completed in Q4-2021. The following preliminary proxy was submitted on 10-18-2021, so we aren't far from the final proxy.

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001855612/000119312521300606/d496451df4a.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001855612/000119312521300606/d496451df4a.htm)

If you've ever taken a ride share in South Asia it was probably through a Grab. It's a great experience all around. However, Grab isn't just a ride-share company, they are a super app, fintech, food delivery, vaccine deliver, and more. Below is the the corporate structure of Grab. This is also a US company merging with a S. Asia company. However, you can view the investors presentation on grab below the company structure.

# Why a SPAC/un-SPAC?:

AGC's CEO is Brad Gerstner a VC, who wanted to do a SPAC because of the broken process in place for IPOs, really it's an un-SPAC trying to build a better IPO. I suggest listening to his reasoning of doing a SPAC deal.

[https://thisweekinstartups.com/altimeter-capital-brad-gerstner-grab-public-largest-spac-fixing-broken-ipo-e1203/](https://thisweekinstartups.com/altimeter-capital-brad-gerstner-grab-public-largest-spac-fixing-broken-ipo-e1203/)

# Floats, Shares, and SIs

I'm going to steal the write up on the float from [u/Lawlpaper](https://www.reddit.com/u/Lawlpaper/) as he did a wonderful job at [r/Shortsqueeze](https://www.reddit.com/r/Shortsqueeze/), you can view his original, which will be more entertaining than mine, I did use my charts instead and included additional data.

What are **floats**? Yeah it's school time because most of you just see someone yell something with rockets and you buy it. You forget to check the SNDL has literal **billions** of shares outstanding. Compare that to GME and why it worked so well, GME has 54**million** during its first squeeze.

Floats are just shares we consider easily sold. **Free Float** they call them. Insiders cannot trade on insider knowledge. Those are called closely held shares. Institutions can trade as they like, but mostly are considered long for both their financial stability to do so, and for tax reasons. They also cant just buy and sell constantly like a day trader as they need to report those. So we are left with the float. Basically, retail and hedge funds that aren't **locked**.

**Locked**? Yes there are locked up shares that cannot be traded no matter what. Those are really important because you know for a fact that they cannot take a dump on you. PROG is living in this alternate reality currently. But we know the date that ends.

# How does this apply to AGC?

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q6lmlqvj1jw71.jpg?width=677&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=150de5c531bfd71eaa6d234c4a082ff9ab3faf46

Since floats are estimates, its hard to figure out what's going on with a normal publicly traded company. That's why we rely on smart people to figure out SPACs and newly deSPACs. Take |RNT for instance. This became a play, and even more so recently.. *yes I sold right before the market closed...* because we figured out that only 25% of the shares were tradable. Here's some numbers for you.

62 million total outstanding shares.

50 million is the number Fintel puts the float. Lazily might I add.

19.2 million minus Institutions.

7.2 million minus everything except the public.

12 million a figure calculated by taking into account that about 80% of the shareholders are known to be holding through the merger for long term.

I'll convince you later why it's really about 87% of the shares will not be traded.

So we got a float, so what?

12 million shares sounds like a **very small floa**t, no? You'd be right, look at the volume over the last week compared to the price action. It's moving easily with some low volume.

# AGC in the past week

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3wz5jnfq1jw71.jpg?width=1553&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8638f919eb1fb1b7035de18b1dfdc3a1e66fc1b

Let it be known, that all of those spike you see, happened with less than a million shares traded. Yeah. 12million float sounds about right.

Can we take into account that over the last week AGC has not stopped going up once?! uh YEAH. It has its ups and downs, like any other small float, but it has been rising steadily.

HEREs THE KICKER - There's 17-19million shares sold short.

We are talking 30% of the TOTAL outstanding shares, and up to 158% of the float by many counts.

158%

Now if you are one of [u/Lawlpaper](https://www.reddit.com/u/Lawlpaper/) followers, you know that he's been preaching 140%. This is because he's been watching the in and outward flow and believes we are sitting at about 17million shorts.

# So, why do the shorts need to cover?

This is my first attempt at a DD, so be easy on me, but please poke holes into my DD and lets have discussion as to why this will be the next 10 bagger.

I'm sure you're tired about hearing about the latest squeeze plays and they never turn out. This is different and I'll tell you why in the following DD. I want all of us to make money on this, if you believe you'll make money going short feel free. I'll be on the other end of the trade collecting your tendies.

# What is Grab?

I will clarify that this play is an active SPAC which some of you may have been involved with when the deal required more time for Grab to get the required financials submitted to the SEC. In fact this is one of the largest SPAC's in the world with a 40b valuation. The CEO stated the merger will be completed in Q4-2013. The following preliminary proxy was submitted on 10-18-2021, so we aren't far from the final proxy.

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001855612/000119312521300606/d496451df4a.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001855612/000119312521300606/d496451df4a.htm)

If you've ever taken a ride share in South Asia it was probably through a Grab. It's a great experience all around. However, Grab isn't just a ride-share company, they are a super app, fintech, food delivery, vaccine deliver, and more. Below is the the corporate structure of Grab. This is also a US company merging with a S. Asia company. However, you can view the investors presentation on grab below the company structure.

# Why a SPAC/un-SPAC?:

AGC's CEO is Brad Gerstner a VC, who wanted to do a SPAC because of the broken process in place for IPOs, really it's an un-SPAC trying to build a better IPO. I suggest listening to his reasoning of doing a SPAC deal.

[https://thisweekinstartups.com/altimeter-capital-brad-gerstner-grab-public-largest-spac-fixing-broken-ipo-e1203/](https://thisweekinstartups.com/altimeter-capital-brad-gerstner-grab-public-largest-spac-fixing-broken-ipo-e1203/)

# Floats, Shares, and SIs

I'm going to steal the write up on the float from [u/Lawlpaper](https://www.reddit.com/u/Lawlpaper/) as he did a wonderful job at [r/Shortsqueeze](https://www.reddit.com/r/Shortsqueeze/), you can view his original, which will be more entertaining than mine, I did use my charts instead and included additional data.

What are **floats**? Yeah it's school time because most of you just see someone yell something with rockets and you buy it. You forget to check the SNDL has literal **billions** of shares outstanding. Compare that to GME and why it worked so well, GME has 54**million** during its first squeeze.

Floats are just shares we consider easily sold. **Free Float** they call them. Insiders cannot trade on insider knowledge. Those are called closely held shares. Institutions can trade as they like, but mostly are considered long for both their financial stability to do so, and for tax reasons. They also cant just buy and sell constantly like a day trader as they need to report those. So we are left with the float. Basically, retail and hedge funds that aren't **locked**.

**Locked**? Yes there are locked up shares that cannot be traded no matter what. Those are really important because you know for a fact that they cannot take a dump on you. PROG is living in this alternate reality currently. But we know the date that ends.

How does this apply to AGC?

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/utes15qcyiw71.jpg?width=677&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ceed0a92e5abc914b0fc43c23e445aa323864f27

Since floats are estimates, its hard to figure out what's going on with a normal publicly traded company. That's why we rely on smart people to figure out SPACs and newly deSPACs. Take |RNT for instance. This became a play, and even more so recently.. *yes I sold right before the market closed...* because we figured out that only 25% of the shares were tradable. Here's some numbers for you.

62 million total outstanding shares.

50 million is the number Fintel puts the float. Lazily might I add.

19.2 million minus Institutions.

7.2 million minus everything except the public.

12 million a figure calculated by taking into account that about 80% of the shareholders are known to be holding through the merger for long term.

I'll convince you later why it's really about 87% of the shares will not be traded.

So we got a float, so what?

12 million shares sounds like a **very small floa**t, no? You'd be right, look at the volume over the last week compared to the price action. It's moving easily with some low volume.

# AGC in the past week

https://preview.redd.it/iv754vjryiw71.jpg?width=1553&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f03f276d98ba0ad7ad86a63f5a2a9aed349cfe8

Let it be known, that all of those spike you see, happened with less than a million shares traded. Yeah. 12million float sounds about right.

Can we take into account that over the last week AGC has not stopped going up once?! uh YEAH. It has its ups and downs, like any other small float, but it has been rising steadily.

HEREs THE KICKER - There's 17-19million shares sold short.

We are talking 30% of the TOTAL outstanding shares, and up to 158% of the float by many counts.

158%

Now if you are one of [u/Lawlpaper](https://www.reddit.com/u/Lawlpaper/) followers, you know that he's been preaching 140%. This is because he's been watching the in and outward flow and believes we are sitting at about 17million shorts.

So, why do the shorts need to cover?

Any price above the red line is 17million shorts underwater

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/talcl6awyiw71.jpg?width=1554&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fef203787fac2d4dde8eee7b414861acc5a05e4c

Look at that graph. That's the last month, he's watched the returned shares, and they haven't returned anything almost. Judging by the previous price, as well as the FTDs we know that all those shorts are underwater:

Now not every failure to deliver is going to be short, some may be longs, but look at the latest data from the SEC.

Also, take note on the daily chart above you'll notice that the institutions are shorting AGC early morning and slowly attempting to cover throughout the day bringing the price back up above where it was. If you pay attention it continues to do a cup pattern, very similar to what B.KKT did.

Also, look at the yearly when the merger was first announced we are at more consistent volume now than it was back then.

We know that 17million shorts that were added before October 15th are now ALL underwater. Volume alone could push margin calls. But you know what else could push margin calls?

This is the latest SI report and AGC is now flagging a Type 3 Squeeze signal:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/slmwav8fziw71.png?width=732&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8954c6ed2896cde03a60c5782accffa9309ac4d

The setup is looking great for the next upward trend which could be very soon.

As of 10-28 according to the [financeheadline.com](https://financeheadline.com/) we are ranked 12 on the short squeeze candidate. The fee is low, but that doesn't mean it will stay low.

# The Merger:

What is different with AGC / Grab than the other short squeezes that you may have failed on? Grab isn't a crap company and as I mentioned above at a 40b valuation you'll be holding something of value. This is the largest SPAC deal in the world by 10 fold.

***Here's some tidbits you didn't know shared by*** [u/Lawlpaper](https://www.reddit.com/u/Lawlpaper/) ***.***

Brokers do not like mergers when it comes to shorts. When a ticker that they loaned is announced to cease to exist through a merger, **they want that share back**. Why? Because they must deliver the new share to the original owner at some point, or at least want theirs back. This isn't the same as Toys r Us where once the tickers ceases to exist you don't owe anyone anything. This share needs to be accounted for.

You can imagine loaning out a share that someone sold, and now knowing that you need either that share back, or a share of the new company. It's much easier and less risky to just get the original share back.

This is why many brokers have **terms** when it comes to tickers that are merging, and no longer to exist. The brokerage will actually **set a date** on which you must cover your short position and return the share. If you've ever been short on a company, **not a put**, that goes through a merger you know this because you got an email with that **date**. The date can be before the merger, or immediately after where you have to buy the new company.

Here's the candy in the pudding, all shorts must be done with **margin accounts**. Margin isn't just money, its any borrowing. This means that your brokerage **can and will** margin call you on the date if you fail to deliver.

Recap:

87% of shares are closely held, not trading.

12mil float

140-158% SI best case

30% SI literal worst case.

We are averaging about 2-3m shares a day now and growing.

There WILL be covering, how much? depends on the brokers.

This isn't a case of only AGC squeezing, once the merger goes into effect Grab will be a spectacular investment. Grab is an amazing company with tremendous value. They not only provide Ride-shade, food delivery, fintech, vaccine delivery, but they're entering the healthcare market soon. Picture Uber, Grub-hub, Paypal, Sofi, and Clov all under one company known for being a super app! The early investors get better perks than us retail with the deal, but they are locked up.

# PIPE my dreams away.. (taken from [u/Lawlpaper](https://www.reddit.com/u/Lawlpaper/) once again)

We all have seen it. Short a new deSPAC. Don't hold through the merger!

Wanna know how serious the investors in AGC and Grab are? The shares are locked up for 3 Years..... **3 mother effing years.** Never before seen in an SPAC. This is some serious belief that GRAB will be worth far more than 40B by 3 years, and they believe there is no need to sell between then. **ONLY UP FROM HERE.** This company is turning out 50%-100%+ revenues each quarter. An absolute machine. The best part? It's all in emerging markets. Asia is growing, and this company will too with it.

**So lets talk the worst case, of the worst case possible:**

&gt;We're wrong, and brokers will let shorts ride through the merger, and not even require them to cover, just giving IOUs to the real share holder and saying ""eff it, who cares if we lent it to them, they sold at $10 and now its most likely going to be $40 in a few months."" Worst case scenario, you end up going up something like 300% in a year. So sorry for your gain.

Let's get this straight. That's not going to happen. Shorts will cover because this isn't ever coming down, and if it does, it wont be for 3 years. They'll get margin called long before then.

But why is there even shorts to begin with?

Good question. We ask that a lot around here. Why double down when retail has pushed it up 300%? Greed. All the delivery services and ride hailing companies got destroyed by COVID. Perfect time to short. What better than to short an SPAC which wall street hates, and one in particular that will probably fall through. They even pushed the merger back, which emboldened the shorts to double down. This was their thought process, I mean, *""Grab had a slowdown, will they even make it through COVID?!""*

LOL, not only did they make it through, they posted another +65% revenue, but during COVID they made themselves more valuable than gold. They expanded their food delivery service, started up their fintech, started expanding their health insurance, and even started a service to deliver vaccines for governments. They drove people for free to get vaccines and COVID tests. Talk about marketing.

The merger is on, expect news like §P®T on October 6th, when it took a 1600% ride over the next couple of weeks.

Grab is situated to go big, really big. Expect $60-$80 in the next couple of years. Which is why, the 17million shorts that sold at $10 will never see their money again. They will cut their losses here soon, or take even bigger ones later.

This is the ground floor.

**The good news, and your TL;DR, Shorts are screwed, and your portfolio will be up if I'm wrong or right.**

*Disclosure: ""AGC DD and why you cannot lose"" is based on not selling for a loss. As with any squeeze there is implied volatility, and this is in no way financial advice.*

A common question. Outstanding shares, PT, and Merger Date.

The rumor going around is between November 1st and the second week of November the deal will be finalized. However, that is just a rumor...  Above you can see the preliminary proxy was filed on 10-18-21, so they are close to closing the deal. I'd be safe and go with calls 12-17 or 1-2022 instead of the Nov 19th calls. This is not financial advice only a mere gamblers advice.

The new company will have the following outstanding shares.

&amp;#x200B;

With the 40B valuation, we are looking at an IPO price of $20 - $52. That's just the price target. We can go under, or over. DASH's IPO was $102, and not even a year later is $200. That just tells us that even if it ends up with 3B shares, we too would see a fundamental rise to at least $40 before the end of 2022. But let me reiterate, GRAB is going to be a juggernaut of a company. Imagine SQ when it IPO'd, $9 per share. GRAB has that kind of upwards availability in their business.",AGC The Inevitable Squeeze,3,1,"AGC The Inevitable Squeeze #  AGC / Grab Merger The Inevitable 10 Bagger

This is my first attempt at a DD, so be easy on me, but please poke holes into my DD and lets have discussion as to why this will be the next 10 bagger.

I'm sure you're tired about hearing about the latest squeeze plays and they never turn out. This is different and I'll tell you why in the following DD. I want all of us to make money on this, if you believe you'll make money going short feel free. I'll be on the other end of the trade collecting your tendies.

# What is Grab?

I will clarify that this play is an active SPAC which some of you may have been involved with when the deal required more time for Grab to get the required financials submitted to the SEC. In fact this is one of the largest SPAC's in the world with a 40b valuation. The CEO stated the merger will be completed in Q4-2013. The following preliminary proxy was submitted on 10-18-2021, so we aren't far from the final proxy.

If you've ever taken a ride share in South Asia it was probably through a Grab. It's a great experience all around. However, Grab isn't just a ride-share company, they are a super app, fintech, food delivery, vaccine deliver, and more. Below is the the corporate structure of Grab. This is also a US company merging with a S. Asia company. However, you can view the investors presentation on grab below the company structure.

# Why a SPAC/un-SPAC?:

AGC's CEO is Brad Gerstner a VC, who wanted to do a SPAC because of the broken process in place for IPOs, really it's an un-SPAC trying to build a better IPO. I suggest listening to his reasoning of doing a SPAC deal.

[https://thisweekinstartups.com/altimeter-capital-brad-gerstner-grab-public-largest-spac-fixing-broken-ipo-e1203/](https://thisweekinstartups.com/altimeter-capital-brad-gerstner-grab-public-largest-spac-fixing-broken-ipo-e1203/)

# Floats, Shares, and SIs

I'm going to steal the write up on the float from [u/Lawlpaper](https://www.reddit.com/u/Lawlpaper/) as he did a wonderful job at [r/Shortsqueeze](https://www.reddit.com/r/Shortsqueeze/), you can view his original, which will be more entertaining than mine, I did use my charts instead and included additional data.

What are **floats**? Yeah it's school time because most of you just see someone yell something with rockets and you buy it. You forget to check the SNDL has literal **billions** of shares outstanding. Compare that to GME and why it worked so well, GME has 54**million** during its first squeeze.

Floats are just shares we consider easily sold. **Free Float** they call them. Insiders cannot trade on insider knowledge. Those are called closely held shares. Institutions can trade as they like, but mostly are considered long for both their financial stability to do so, and for tax reasons. They also cant just buy and sell constantly like a day trader as they need to report those. So we are left with the float. Basically, retail and hedge funds that aren't **locked**.

**Locked**? Yes there are locked up shares that cannot be traded no matter what. Those are really important because you know for a fact that they cannot take a dump on you. PROG is living in this alternate reality currently. But we know the date that ends.

How does this apply to AGC?

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/utes15qcyiw71.jpg?width=677&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ceed0a92e5abc914b0fc43c23e445aa323864f27

Since floats are estimates, its hard to figure out what's going on with a normal publicly traded company. That's why we rely on smart people to figure out SPACs and newly deSPACs. Take |RNT for instance. This became a play, and even more so recently.. *yes I sold right before the market closed...* because we figured out that only 25% of the shares were tradable. Here's some numbers for you.

62 million total outstanding shares.

50 million is the number Fintel puts the float. Lazily might I add.

19.2 million minus Institutions.

7.2 million minus everything except the public.

12 million a figure calculated by taking into account that about 80% of the shareholders are known to be holding through the merger for long term.

I'll convince you later why it's really about 87% of the shares will not be traded.

So we got a float, so what?

12 million shares sounds like a **very small floa**t, no? You'd be right, look at the volume over the last week compared to the price action. It's moving easily with some low volume.

# AGC in the past week

https://preview.redd.it/iv754vjryiw71.jpg?width=1553&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f03f276d98ba0ad7ad86a63f5a2a9aed349cfe8

Let it be known, that all of those spike you see, happened with less than a million shares traded. Yeah. 12million float sounds about right.

Can we take into account that over the last week AGC has not stopped going up once?! uh YEAH. It has its ups and downs, like any other small float, but it has been rising steadily.

HEREs THE KICKER - There's 17-19million shares sold short.

We are talking 30% of the TOTAL outstanding shares, and up to 158% of the float by many counts.

158%

Now if you are one of [u/Lawlpaper](https://www.reddit.com/u/Lawlpaper/) followers, you know that he's been preaching 140%. This is because he's been watching the in and outward flow and believes we are sitting at about 17million shorts.

So, why do the shorts need to cover?

Any price above the red line is 17million shorts underwater

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/talcl6awyiw71.jpg?width=1554&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fef203787fac2d4dde8eee7b414861acc5a05e4c

Look at that graph. That's the last month, he's watched the returned shares, and they haven't returned anything almost. Judging by the previous price, as well as the FTDs we know that all those shorts are underwater:

Now not every failure to deliver is going to be short, some may be longs, but look at the latest data from the SEC.

Also, take note on the daily chart above you'll notice that the institutions are shorting AGC early morning and slowly attempting to cover throughout the day bringing the price back up above where it was. If you pay attention it continues to do a cup pattern, very similar to what B.KKT did.

Also, look at the yearly when the merger was first announced we are at more consistent volume now than it was back then.

We know that 17million shorts that were added before October 15th are now ALL underwater. Volume alone could push margin calls. But you know what else could push margin calls?

This is the latest SI report and AGC is now flagging a Type 3 Squeeze signal:

&amp;#x200B;

The setup is looking great for the next upward trend which could be very soon.

As of 10-28 according to the [financeheadline.com](https://financeheadline.com/) we are ranked 12 on the short squeeze candidate. The fee is low, but that doesn't mean it will stay low.

# The Merger:

What is different with AGC / Grab than the other short squeezes that you may have failed on? Grab isn't a crap company and as I mentioned above at a 40b valuation you'll be holding something of value. This is the largest SPAC deal in the world by 10 fold.

***Here's some tidbits you didn't know shared by*** [u/Lawlpaper](https://www.reddit.com/u/Lawlpaper/) ***.***

Brokers do not like mergers when it comes to shorts. When a ticker that they loaned is announced to cease to exist through a merger, **they want that share back**. Why? Because they must deliver the new share to the original owner at some point, or at least want theirs back. This isn't the same as Toys r Us where once the tickers ceases to exist you don't owe anyone anything. This share needs to be accounted for.

You can imagine loaning out a share that someone sold, and now knowing that you need either that share back, or a share of the new company. It's much easier and less risky to just get the original share back.

This is why many brokers have **terms** when it comes to tickers that are merging, and no longer to exist. The brokerage will actually **set a date** on which you must cover your short position and return the share. If you've ever been short on a company, **not a put**, that goes through a merger you know this because you got an email with that **date**. The date can be before the merger, or immediately after where you have to buy the new company.

Here's the candy in the pudding, all shorts must be done with **margin accounts**. Margin isn't just money, its any borrowing. This means that your brokerage **can and will** margin call you on the date if you fail to deliver.

Recap:

87% of shares are closely held, not trading.

12mil float

140-158% SI best case

30% SI literal worst case.

We are averaging about 2-3m shares a day now and growing.

There WILL be covering, how much? depends on the brokers.

This isn't a case of only AGC squeezing, once the merger goes into effect Grab will be a spectacular investment. Grab is an amazing company with tremendous value. They not only provide Ride-shade, food delivery, fintech, vaccine delivery, but they're entering the healthcare market soon. Picture Uber, Grub-hub, Paypal, Sofi, and Clov all under one company known for being a super app! The early investors get better perks than us retail with the deal, but they are locked up.

# PIPE my dreams away.. (taken from [u/Lawlpaper](https://www.reddit.com/u/Lawlpaper/) once again)

We all have seen it. Short a new deSPAC. Don't hold through the merger!

Wanna know how serious the investors in AGC and Grab are? The shares are locked up for 3 Years..... **3 mother effing years.** Never before seen in an SPAC. This is some serious belief that GRAB will be worth far more than 40B by 3 years, and they believe there is no need to sell between then. **ONLY UP FROM HERE.** This company is turning out 50%-100%+ revenues each quarter. An absolute machine. The best part? It's all in emerging markets. Asia is growing, and this company will too with it.

**So lets talk the worst case, of the worst case possible:**

&gt;We're wrong, and brokers will let shorts ride through the merger, and not even require them to cover, just giving IOUs to the real share holder and saying ""eff it, who cares if we lent it to them, they sold at $10 and now its most likely going to be $40 in a few months."" Worst case scenario, you end up going up something like 300% in a year. So sorry for your gain.

Let's get this straight. That's not going to happen. Shorts will cover because this isn't ever coming down, and if it does, it wont be for 3 years. They'll get margin called long before then.

But why is there even shorts to begin with?

Good question. We ask that a lot around here. Why double down when retail has pushed it up 300%? Greed. All the delivery services and ride hailing companies got destroyed by COVID. Perfect time to short. What better than to short an SPAC which wall street hates, and one in particular that will probably fall through. They even pushed the merger back, which emboldened the shorts to double down. This was their thought process, I mean, *""Grab had a slowdown, will they even make it through COVID?!""*

LOL, not only did they make it through, they posted another +65% revenue, but during COVID they made themselves more valuable than gold. They expanded their food delivery service, started up their fintech, started expanding their health insurance, and even started a service to deliver vaccines for governments. They drove people for free to get vaccines and COVID tests. Talk about marketing.

The merger is on, expect news like §P®T on October 6th, when it took a 1600% ride over the next couple of weeks.

Grab is situated to go big, really big. Expect $60-$80 in the next couple of years. Which is why, the 17million shorts that sold at $10 will never see their money again. They will cut their losses here soon, or take even bigger ones later.

This is the ground floor.

**The good news, and your TL;DR, Shorts are screwed, and your portfolio will be up if I'm wrong or right.**

*Disclosure: ""AGC DD and why you cannot lose"" is based on not selling for a loss. As with any squeeze there is implied volatility, and this is in no way financial advice.*

A common question. Outstanding shares, PT, and Merger Date.

The rumor going around is between November 1st and the second week of November the deal will be finalized. However, that is just a rumor...  Above you can see the preliminary proxy was filed on 10-18-21, so they are close to closing the deal. I'd be safe and go with calls 12-17 or 1-2022 instead of the Nov 19th calls.

This is my first attempt at a DD, so be easy on me, but please poke holes into my DD and lets have discussion as to why this will be the next 10 bagger.

I'm sure you're tired about hearing about the latest squeeze plays and they never turn out. This is different and I'll tell you why in the following DD. I want all of us to make money on this, if you believe you'll make money going short feel free. I'll be on the other end of the trade collecting your tendies.

# What is Grab?

I will clarify that this play is an active SPAC which some of you may have been involved with when the deal required more time for Grab to get the required financials submitted to the SEC. In fact this is one of the largest SPAC's in the world with a 40b valuation. The CEO stated the merger will be completed in Q4-2013. The following preliminary proxy was submitted on 10-18-2021, so we aren't far from the final proxy.

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001855612/000119312521300606/d496451df4a.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001855612/000119312521300606/d496451df4a.htm)

If you've ever taken a ride share in South Asia it was probably through a Grab. It's a great experience all around. However, Grab isn't just a ride-share company, they are as super app, fintech, food delivery, vaccine deliver, and more. Below is the the corporate structure of Grab. This is also a US company merging with a S. Asia company. However, you can view the investors presentation on grab below the company structure.

# Why a SPAC/un-SPAC?:

AGC's CEO is Brad Gerstner a VC, who wanted to do a SPAC because of the broken process in place for IPOs, really it's an un-SPAC trying to build a better IPO. I suggest listening to his reasoning of doing a SPAC deal.

[https://thisweekinstartups.com/altimeter-capital-brad-gerstner-grab-public-largest-spac-fixing-broken-ipo-e1203/](https://thisweekinstartups.com/altimeter-capital-brad-gerstner-grab-public-largest-spac-fixing-broken-ipo-e1203/)

# Floats, Shares, and SIs

I'm going to steal the write up on the float from [u/Lawlpaper](https://www.reddit.com/u/Lawlpaper/) as he did a wonderful job at [r/Shortsqueeze](https://www.reddit.com/r/Shortsqueeze/), you can view his original, which will be more entertaining than mine, I did use my charts instead and included additional data.

What are **floats**? Yeah it's school time because most of you just see someone yell something with rockets and you buy it. You forget to check the SNDL has literal **billions** of shares outstanding. Compare that to GME and why it worked so well, GME has 54**million** during its first squeeze.

Floats are just shares we consider easily sold. **Free Float** they call them. Insiders cannot trade on insider knowledge. Those are called closely held shares. Institutions can trade as they like, but mostly are considered long for both their financial stability to do so, and for tax reasons. They also cant just buy and sell constantly like a day trader as they need to report those. So we are left with the float. Basically, retail and hedge funds that aren't **locked**.

**Locked**? Yes there are locked up shares that cannot be traded no matter what. Those are really important because you know for a fact that they cannot take a dump on you. PROG is living in this alternate reality currently. But we know the date that ends.

# How does this apply to AGC?

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vfvclfm6viw71.jpg?width=677&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=907b0a810741347fdc2d1721b8cd3336bea5df46

Since floats are estimates, its hard to figure out what's going on with a normal publicly traded company. That's why we rely on smart people to figure out SPACs and newly deSPACs. Take |RNT for instance. This became a play, and even more so recently.. *yes I sold right before the market closed...* because we figured out that only 25% of the shares were tradable. Here's some numbers for you.

62 million total outstanding shares.

50 million is the number Fintel puts the float. Lazily might I add.

19.2 million minus Institutions.

7.2 million minus everything except the public.

12 million a figure calculated by taking into account that about 80% of the shareholders are known to be holding through the merger for long term.

I'll convince you later why it's really about 87% of the shares will not be traded.

So we got a float, so what?

12 million shares sounds like a **very small floa**t, no? You'd be right, look at the volume over the last week compared to the price action. It's moving easily with some low volume.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5tmk2j18viw71.jpg?width=1553&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2edfe6b2a18dfbc099751ede201213182296fd98

AGC in the past week

Let it be known, that all of those spike you see, happened with less than a million shares traded. Yeah. 12million float sounds about right.

Can we take into account that over the last week AGC has not stopped going up once?! uh YEAH. It has its ups and downs, like any other small float, but it has been rising steadily.

HEREs THE KICKER - There's 17-19million shares sold short.

We are talking 30% of the TOTAL outstanding shares, and up to 158% of the float by many counts.

158%

Now if you are one of [u/Lawlpaper](https://www.reddit.com/u/Lawlpaper/) followers, you know that he's been preaching 140%. This is because he's been watching the in and outward flow and believes we are sitting at about 17million shorts.

So, why do the shorts need to cover?

Any price above the red line is 17million shorts underwater

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ml9ynmgbviw71.jpg?width=1554&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67c1eb506e9896e7785170648810f87ebcdbbdf2

Look at that graph. That's the last month, he's watched the returned shares, and they haven't returned anything almost. Judging by the previous price, as well as the FTDs we know that all those shorts are underwater:

Now not every failure to deliver is going to be short, some may be longs, but look at the latest data from the SEC.

Also, take note on the daily chart above you'll notice that the institutions are shorting AGC early morning and slowly attempting to cover throughout the day bringing the price back up above where it was. If you pay attention it continues to do a cup pattern, very similar to what B.KKT did.

&amp;#x200B;

We know that 17million shorts that were added before October 15th are now ALL underwater. Volume alone could push margin calls. But you know what else could push margin calls?

This is the latest SI report and AGC is now flagging a Type 3 Squeeze signal:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eiepfb34wiw71.png?width=732&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d75e01ad6909fb52022dfbb7c67eb78ab7ac675a

The setup is looking great for the next upward trend which could be very soon.

As of 10-28 according to the [financeheadline.com](https://financeheadline.com/) we are ranked 12 on the short squeeze candidate. The fee is low, but that doesn't mean it will stay low.

# The Merger:

What is different with AGC / Grab than the other short squeezes that you may have failed on? Grab isn't a crap company and as I mentioned above at a 40b valuation you'll be holding something of value. This is the largest SPAC deal in the world by 10 fold.

***Here's some tidbits you didn't know shared by*** [u/Lawlpaper](https://www.reddit.com/u/Lawlpaper/) ***.***

Brokers do not like mergers when it comes to shorts. When a ticker that they loaned is announced to cease to exist through a merger, **they want that share back**. Why? Because they must deliver the new share to the original owner at some point, or at least want theirs back. This isn't the same as Toys r Us where once the tickers ceases to exist you don't owe anyone anything. This share needs to be accounted for.

You can imagine loaning out a share that someone sold, and now knowing that you need either that share back, or a share of the new company. It's much easier and less risky to just get the original share back.

This is why many brokers have **terms** when it comes to tickers that are merging, and no longer to exist. The brokerage will actually **set a date** on which you must cover your short position and return the share. If you've ever been short on a company, **not a put**, that goes through a merger you know this because you got an email with that **date**. The date can be before the merger, or immediately after where you have to buy the new company.

Here's the candy in the pudding, all shorts must be done with **margin accounts**. Margin isn't just money, its any borrowing. This means that your brokerage **can and will** margin call you on the date if you fail to deliver.

# Recap:

87% of shares are closely held, not trading.

12mil float

140-158% SI best case

30% SI literal worst case.

We are averaging about 2-3m shares a day now and growing.

There WILL be covering, how much? depends on the brokers.

This isn't a case of only AGC squeezing, once the merger goes into effect Grab will be a spectacular investment. Grab is an amazing company with tremendous value. They not only provide Ride-shade, food delivery, fintech, vaccine delivery, but they're entering the healthcare market soon. Picture Uber, Grub-hub, Paypal, Sofi, and Clov all under one company known for being a super app! The early investors get better perks than us retail with the deal, but they are locked up.

# PIPE my dreams away.. (taken from [u/Lawlpaper](https://www.reddit.com/u/Lawlpaper/) once again)

We all have seen it. Short a new deSPAC. Don't hold through the merger!

Wanna know how serious the investors in AGC and Grab are? The shares are locked up for 3 Years..... **3 mother effing years.** Never before seen in an SPAC. This is some serious belief that GRAB will be worth far more than 40B by 3 years, and they believe there is no need to sell between then. **ONLY UP FROM HERE.** This company is turning out 50%-100%+ revenues each quarter. An absolute machine. The best part? It's all in emerging markets. Asia is growing, and this company will too with it.

**So lets talk the worst case, of the worst case possible:**

&gt;We're wrong, and brokers will let shorts ride through the merger, and not even require them to cover, just giving IOUs to the real share holder and saying ""eff it, who cares if we lent it to them, they sold at $10 and now its most likely going to be $40 in a few months."" Worst case scenario, you end up going up something like 300% in a year. So sorry for your gain.

Let's get this straight. That's not going to happen. Shorts will cover because this isn't ever coming down, and if it does, it wont be for 3 years. They'll get margin called long before then.

# But why is there even shorts to begin with?

Good question. We ask that a lot around here. Why double down when retail has pushed it up 300%? Greed. All the delivery services and ride hailing companies got destroyed by COVID. Perfect time to short. What better than to short an SPAC which wall street hates, and one in particular that will probably fall through. They even pushed the merger back, which emboldened the shorts to double down. This was their thought process, I mean, *""Grab had a slowdown, will they even make it through COVID?!""*

LOL, not only did they make it through, they posted another +65% revenue, but during COVID they made themselves more valuable than gold. They expanded their food delivery service, started up their fintech, started expanding their health insurance, and even started a service to deliver vaccines for governments. They drove people for free to get vaccines and COVID tests. Talk about marketing.

The merger is on, expect news like §PRT on October 6th, when it took a 1600% ride over the next couple of weeks.

Grab is situated to go big, really big. Expect $60-$80 in the next couple of years. Which is why, the 17million shorts that sold at $10 will never see their money again. They will cut their losses here soon, or take even bigger ones later.

This is the ground floor.

**The good news, and your TL;DR, Shorts are screwed, and your portfolio will be up if I'm wrong or right.**

*Disclosure: ""AGC DD and why you cannot lose"" is based on not selling for a loss. As with any squeeze there is implied volatility, and this is in no way financial advice.*

A common question. Outstanding shares, PT, and Merger Date.

The rumor going around is between November 1st and the second week of November the deal will be finalized. Above you can see the preliminary proxy was filed on 10-18-21, so they are close to closing the deal. I'd be safe and go with calls 12-17 or 1-2022 instead of the Nov 19th calls.

The new company will have the following outstanding shares.

&amp;#x200B;

With the 40B valuation, we are looking at an IPO price of $20 - $52. That's just the price target. We can go under, or over. DASH's IPO was $102, and not even a year later is $200. That just tells us that even if it ends up with 3B shares, we too would see a fundamental rise to at least $40 before the end of 2022. But let me reiterate, GRAB is going to be a juggernaut of a company. Imagine SQ when it IPO'd, $9 per share. GRAB has that kind of upwards availability in their business.",Inevitable AGC Squeeze,3,1,"Inevitable AGC Squeeze #  AGC / Grab Merger The Inevitable 10 Bagger

AGC in the past week

Let it be known, that all of those spike you see, happened with less than a million shares traded. Yeah. 12million float sounds about right.

Can we take into account that over the last week AGC has not stopped going up once?! uh YEAH. It has its ups and downs, like any other small float, but it has been rising steadily.

HEREs THE KICKER - There's 17-19million shares sold short.

We are talking 30% of the TOTAL outstanding shares, and up to 158% of the float by many counts.

158%

Now if you are one of [u/Lawlpaper](https://www.reddit.com/u/Lawlpaper/) followers, you know that he's been preaching 140%. This is because he's been watching the in and outward flow and believes we are sitting at about 17million shorts.

So, why do the shorts need to cover?

Any price above the red line is 17million shorts underwater

&amp;#x200B;

Look at that graph. That's the last month, he's watched the returned shares, and they haven't returned anything almost. Judging by the previous price, as well as the FTDs we know that all those shorts are underwater:

Now not every failure to deliver is going to be short, some may be longs, but look at the latest data from the SEC.

Also, take note on the daily chart above you'll notice that the institutions are shorting AGC early morning and slowly attempting to cover throughout the day bringing the price back up above where it was. If you pay attention it continues to do a cup pattern, very similar to what B.KKT did.

We know that 17million shorts that were added before October 15th are now ALL underwater. Volume alone could push margin calls. But you know what else could push margin calls?

This is the latest SI report and AGC is now flagging a Type 3 Squeeze signal:

&amp;#x200B;

The setup is looking great for the next upward trend which could be very soon.

As of 10-28 according to the [financeheadline.com](https://financeheadline.com/) we are ranked 12 on the short squeeze candidate. The fee is low, but that doesn't mean it will stay low.

# The Merger:

What is different with AGC / Grab than the other short squeezes that you may have failed on? Grab isn't a crap company and as I mentioned above at a 40b valuation you'll be holding something of value. This is the largest SPAC deal in the world by 10 fold.

***Here's some tidbits you didn't know shared by*** [u/Lawlpaper](https://www.reddit.com/u/Lawlpaper/) ***.***

Brokers do not like mergers when it comes to shorts. When a ticker that they loaned is announced to cease to exist through a merger, **they want that share back**. Why? Because they must deliver the new share to the original owner at some point, or at least want theirs back. This isn't the same as Toys r Us where once the tickers ceases to exist you don't owe anyone anything. This share needs to be accounted for.

You can imagine loaning out a share that someone sold, and now knowing that you need either that share back, or a share of the new company. It's much easier and less risky to just get the original share back.

This is why many brokers have **terms** when it comes to tickers that are merging, and no longer to exist. The brokerage will actually **set a date** on which you must cover your short position and return the share. If you've ever been short on a company, **not a put**, that goes through a merger you know this because you got an email with that **date**. The date can be before the merger, or immediately after where you have to buy the new company.

Here's the candy in the pudding, all shorts must be done with **margin accounts**. Margin isn't just money, its any borrowing. This means that your brokerage **can and will** margin call you on the date if you fail to deliver.

# Recap:

87% of shares are closely held, not trading.

12mil float

140-158% SI best case

30% SI literal worst case.

We are averaging about 2-3m shares a day now and growing.

There WILL be covering, how much? depends on the brokers.

This isn't a case of only AGC squeezing, once the merger goes into effect Grab will be a spectacular investment. Grab is an amazing company with tremendous value. They not only provide Ride-shade, food delivery, fintech, vaccine delivery, but they're entering the healthcare market soon. Picture Uber, Grub-hub, Paypal, Sofi, and Clov all under one company known for being a super app! The early investors get better perks than us retail with the deal, but they are locked up.

# PIPE my dreams away.. (taken from [u/Lawlpaper](https://www.reddit.com/u/Lawlpaper/) once again)

We all have seen it. Short a new deSPAC. Don't hold through the merger!

Wanna know how serious the investors in AGC and Grab are? The shares are locked up for 3 Years..... **3 mother effing years.** Never before seen in an SPAC. This is some serious belief that GRAB will be worth far more than 40B by 3 years, and they believe there is no need to sell between then. **ONLY UP FROM HERE.** This company is turning out 50%-100%+ revenues each quarter. An absolute machine. The best part? It's all in emerging markets. Asia is growing, and this company will too with it.

**So lets talk the worst case, of the worst case possible:**

&gt;We're wrong, and brokers will let shorts ride through the merger, and not even require them to cover, just giving IOUs to the real share holder and saying ""eff it, who cares if we lent it to them, they sold at $10 and now its most likely going to be $40 in a few months."" Worst case scenario, you end up going up something like 300% in a year. So sorry for your gain.

Let's get this straight. That's not going to happen. Shorts will cover because this isn't ever coming down, and if it does, it wont be for 3 years. They'll get margin called long before then.

# But why is there even shorts to begin with?

Good question. We ask that a lot around here. Why double down when retail has pushed it up 300%? Greed. All the delivery services and ride hailing companies got destroyed by COVID. Perfect time to short. What better than to short an SPAC which wall street hates, and one in particular that will probably fall through. They even pushed the merger back, which emboldened the shorts to double down. This was their thought process, I mean, *""Grab had a slowdown, will they even make it through COVID?!""*

LOL, not only did they make it through, they posted another +65% revenue, but during COVID they made themselves more valuable than gold. They expanded their food delivery service, started up their fintech, started expanding their health insurance, and even started a service to deliver vaccines for governments. They drove people for free to get vaccines and COVID tests. Talk about marketing.

The merger is on, expect news like §PRT on October 6th, when it took a 1600% ride over the next couple of weeks.

Grab is situated to go big, really big. Expect $60-$80 in the next couple of years. Which is why, the 17million shorts that sold at $10 will never see their money again. They will cut their losses here soon, or take even bigger ones later.

This is the ground floor.

**The good news, and your TL;DR, Shorts are screwed, and your portfolio will be up if I'm wrong or right.**

*Disclosure: ""AGC DD and why you cannot lose"" is based on not selling for a loss. As with any squeeze there is implied volatility, and this is in no way financial advice.*

A common question. Outstanding shares, PT, and Merger Date.

The rumor going around is between November 1st and the second week of November the deal will be finalized. Above you can see the preliminary proxy was filed on 10-18-21, so they are close to closing the deal. I'd be safe and go with calls 12-17 or 1-2022 instead of the Nov 19th calls.

The new company will have the following outstanding shares.

&amp;#x200B;

With the 40B valuation, we are looking at an IPO price of $20 - $52. That's just the price target. We can go under, or over. DASH's IPO was $102, and not even a year later is $200. That just tells us that even if it ends up with 3B shares, we too would see a fundamental rise to at least $40 before the end of 2022. But let me reiterate, GRAB is going to be a juggernaut of a company. Imagine SQ when it IPO'd, $9 per share. GRAB has that kind of upwards availability in their business.",Inevitable AGC Squeeze AGC Grab Merger The Inevitable Bagger This first attempt DD easy please poke hole DD let discussion next bagger I

I'm sure you're tired about hearing about squeeze plays and they never turn out.  I want all of us to make money on this, if you believe you'll make money going short feel free.  I'll be on the other end of the trade collecting your tendies.  

# What is Grab?

I will clarify that this play is an active SPAC which some of you may have been involved with when the deal required more time for Grab to get the required financials submitted to the SEC.  In fact this is one of the largest SPAC's in the world with a 40b valuation.  The CEO stated the merger will be completed in Q4-2013.  The following preliminary proxy was submitted on 10-18-2021, so we aren't far from the final proxy.

If you've ever taken a ride share in South Asia it was probably through a Grab.  It's a great experience all around.  However, Grab isn't just a ride-share company, they are as super app, fintech, food delivery, vaccine deliver, and more.  Below is the the corporate structure of Grab. This is also a US company merging with a S. Asia company. However, you can view the investors presentation on grab below the company structure.

# Why a SPAC/un-SPAC?:

AGC's CEO is Brad Gerstner a VC, who wanted to do a SPAC because of the broken process in place for IPOs, really it's an un-SPAC trying to build a better IPO.  I suggest listening to his reasoning of doing a SPAC deal.

[https://thisweekinstartups.com/altimeter-capital-brad-gerstner-grab-public-largest-spac-fixing-broken-ipo-e1203/](https://thisweekinstartups.com/altimeter-capital-brad-gerstner-grab-public-largest-spac-fixing-broken-ipo-e1203/)

# Floats, Shares, and SIs

I'm going to steal the write up on the float from u/Lawlpaper as he did a wonderful job at r/Shortsqueeze, you can view his original, which will be more entertaining than mine, I did use my charts instead and included additional data.  

What are **floats**? Yeah it's school time because most of you just see someone yell something with rockets and you buy it. You forget to check the SNDL has literal **billions** of shares outstanding. Compare that to GME and why it worked so well, GME has 54**million** during its first squeeze.

Floats are just shares we consider easily sold. **Free Float** they call them. Insiders cannot trade on insider knowledge. Those are called closely held shares. Institutions can trade as they like, but mostly are considered long for both their financial stability to do so, and for tax reasons. They also cant just buy and sell constantly like a day trader as they need to report those. So we are left with the float. Basically, retail and hedge funds that aren't **locked**.

**Locked**? Yes there are locked up shares that cannot be traded no matter what. Those are really important because you know for a fact that they cannot take a dump on you. PROG is living in this alternate reality currently. But we know the date that ends.

How does this apply to AGC?

Since floats are estimates, its hard to figure out what's going on with a normal publicly traded company. That's why we rely on smart people to figure out SPACs and newly deSPACs. Take IRNT for instance. This became a play, and even more so recently.. *yes I sold right before the market closed...* because we figured out that only 25% of the shares were tradable. Here's some numbers for you.

62 million total outstanding shares.

50 million is the number Fintel puts the float. Lazily might I add.

19.2 million minus Institutions.

7.2 million minus everything except the public.

12 million a figure calculated by taking into account that about 80% of the shareholders are known to be holding through the merger for long term.

I'll convince you later why it's really about 87% of the shares will not be traded.

So we got a float, so what?

12 million shares sounds like a **very small floa**t, no? You'd be right, look at the volume over the last week compared to the price action. It's moving easily with some low volume.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p5twzmhiciw71.jpg?width=1553&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5682d3a1775f58dac06b66b29c1525a790ae350

AGC in the past week

Let it be known, that all of those spike you see, happened with less than a million shares traded. Yeah. 12million float sounds about right.

Can we take into account that over the last week AGC has not stopped going up once?! uh YEAH. It has its ups and downs, like any other small float, but it has been rising steadily.

HEREs THE KICKER - There's 17-19million shares sold short.

We are talking 30% of the TOTAL outstanding shares, and up to 158% of the float by many counts.

158%

Now if you are one of u/Lawlpaper followers, you know that he's been preaching 140%. This is because he's been watching the in and outward flow and believes we are sitting at about 17million shorts.

# So, why do the shorts need to cover?

Any price above the red line is 17million shorts underwater

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j2vdjxrpeiw71.jpg?width=1554&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c635bd9ed88a0f9562365e01102eeb7278e3cc6

Look at that graph. That's the last month, he's watched the returned shares, and they haven't returned anything almost. Judging by the previous price, as well as the FTDs we know that all those shorts are underwater:

Now not every failure to deliver is going to be short, some may be longs, but look at the latest data from the SEC.

Also, take note on the daily chart above you'll notice that the institutions are shorting AGC early morning and slowly attempting to cover throughout the day bringing the price back up above where it was.  If you pay attention it continues to do a cup pattern, very similar to what BKKT did.

We know that 17million shorts that were added before October 15th are now ALL underwater. Volume alone could push margin calls. But you know what else could push margin calls?

This is the latest SI report and AGC is now flagging a Type 3 Squeeze signal:

&amp;#x200B;

# The Merger:

What is different with AGC / GHL (Grab) than the other short squeezes that you may have failed on?  Grab isn't a crap company and as I mentioned above at a 40b valuation you'll be holding something of value.  This is the largest SPAC deal in the world by 10 fold. 

***Here's some tidbits you didn't know shared by*** u/Lawlpaper ***.***

Brokers do not like mergers when it comes to shorts. When a ticker that they loaned is announced to cease to exist through a merger, **they want that share back**. Why? Because they must deliver the new share to the original owner at some point, or at least want theirs back. This isn't the same as Toys r Us where once the tickers ceases to exist you don't owe anyone anything. This share needs to be accounted for.

You can imagine loaning out a share that someone sold, and now knowing that you need either that share back, or a share of the new company. It's much easier and less risky to just get the original share back.

This is why many brokers have **terms** when it comes to tickers that are merging, and no longer to exist. The brokerage will actually **set a date** on which you must cover your short position and return the share. If you've ever been short on a company, **not a put**, that goes through a merger you know this because you got an email with that **date**. The date can be before the merger, or immediately after where you have to buy the new company.

Here's the candy in the pudding, all shorts must be done with **margin accounts**. Margin isn't just money, its any borrowing. This means that your brokerage **can and will** margin call you on the date if you fail to deliver.

#  Recap:

87% of shares are closely held, not trading.

12mil float

140-158% SI best case

30% SI literal worst case.

We are averaging about 2-3m shares a day now and growing.

There WILL be covering, how much? depends on the brokers.

This isn't a case of only AGC squeezing, once the merger goes into effect Grab will be a spectacular investment.  Grab is an amazing company with tremendous value.  They not only provide Ride-shade, food delivery, fintech, vaccine delivery, but they're entering the healthcare market soon.  Picture Uber, Grub-hub, Paypal, Sofi, and Clov all under one company known for being a super app!  The early investors get better perks than us retail with the deal, but they are locked up.

# PIPE my dreams away.. (taken from u/Lawlpaper once again)

We all have seen it. Short a new deSPAC. Don't hold through the merger!

Wanna know how serious the investors in AGC and Grab are? The shares are locked up for 3 Years..... **3 mother effing years.** Never before seen in an SPAC. This is some serious belief that GRAB will be worth far more than 40B by 3 years, and they believe there is no need to sell between then. **ONLY UP FROM HERE.** This company is turning out 50%-100%+ revenues each quarter. An absolute machine. The best part? It's all in emerging markets. Asia is growing, and this company will too with it.

**So lets talk the worst case, of the worst case possible:**

&gt;We're wrong, and brokers will let shorts ride through the merger, and not even require them to cover, just giving IOUs to the real share holder and saying ""eff it, who cares if we lent it to them, they sold at $10 and now its most likely going to be $40 in a few months."" Worst case scenario, you end up going up something like 300% in a year. So sorry for your gain.

Let's get this straight. That's not going to happen. Shorts will cover because this isn't ever coming down, and if it does, it wont be for 3 years. They'll get margin called long before then.

But why is there even shorts to begin with?

Good question. We ask that a lot around here. Why double down when retail has pushed it up 300%? Greed. All the delivery services and ride hailing companies got destroyed by COVID. Perfect time to short. What better than to short an SPAC which wall street hates, and one in particular that will probably fall through. They even pushed the merger back, which emboldened the shorts to double down. This was their thought process, I mean, *""Grab had a slowdown, will they even make it through COVID?!""*

LOL, not only did they make it through, they posted another +65% revenue, but during COVID they made themselves more valuable than gold. They expanded their food delivery service, started up their fintech, started expanding their health insurance, and even started a service to deliver vaccines for governments. They drove people for free to get vaccines and COVID tests. Talk about marketing.

The merger is on, expect news like SPRT on October 6th, when it took a 1600% ride over the next couple of weeks.

Grab is situated to go big, really big. Expect $60-$80 in the next couple of years. Which is why, the 17million shorts that sold at $10 will never see their money again. They will cut their losses here soon, or take even bigger ones later.

This is the ground floor.

**The good news, and your TL;DR, Shorts are screwed, and your portfolio will be up if I'm wrong or right.**

*Disclosure: ""AGC DD and why you cannot lose"" is based on not selling for a loss. As with any squeeze there is implied volatility, and this is in no way financial advice.*

A common question. Outstanding shares, PT, and Merger Date.

The rumor going around is between November 1st and the second week of November the deal will be finalized.  Above you can see the preliminary proxy was filed on 10-18-21, so they are close to closing the deal.  I'd be safe and go with calls 12-17 or 1-2022 instead of the Nov 19th calls.

The new company will have the following outstanding shares. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/o7tcjai4niw71.png?width=1387&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6e37ecfea2f758c23401fc641b389f60b5bfbd3

With the 40B valuation, we are looking at an IPO price of $20 - $52. That's just the price target. We can go under, or over. DASH's IPO was $102, and not even a year later is $200. That just tells us that even if it ends up with 3B shares, we too would see a fundamental rise to at least $40 before the end of 2022. But let me reiterate, GRAB is going to be a juggernaut of a company. Imagine SQ when it IPO'd, $9 per share. GRAB has that kind of upwards availability in their business.",AGC / Grab (GHL) - DD,3,1,"AGC / Grab (GHL) - DD # AGC / Grab (GHL) Merger The Inevitable 10 Bagger

This is my first attempt at a DD, so be easy on me, but please poke holes into my DD and lets have discussion as to why this will be the next 10 bagger.

That just tells us that even if it ends up with 3B shares, we too would see a fundamental rise to at least $40 before the end of 2022. But let me reiterate, GRAB is going to be a juggernaut of a company. Imagine SQ when it IPO'd, $9 per share.

# Abstract

$NLS

As the world is eyeing the possible end of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is evident that investors currently see the at-home fitness industry as an industry inorganically fuelled by COVID-19 consumer habits. While one may agree with that hypothesis, Nautilus, along with its peers, have dropped circa 70% since their February highs. On an industry basis, investors may be too optimistic about consumer habits and ‘life after COVID’. The world has adapted to a hybrid WFH lifestyle post pandemic and physical exercise also indicates similar trends. The Les Mills October 2021 survey of 13,000 gym consumers worldwide, found that the majority of consumers favour a 60:40 split between gym and at home workouts. While 80% of those surveyed indicated that they plan to continue to use digital workouts post pandemic. This further iterates the total addressable market that JRNY is able to infiltrate and thereafter monetise. Further to that, it was found that digital fitness users’ workout 22% more than live only exercisers, while 84% of gym members continually workout at home also. It is clear that consumer trends are favouring organic growth over the coming years for Nautilus.

**The Industry**

The fitness industry as a whole has been one of very little growth or innovation within the last 2 decades. 2015 saw the first glimpse of innovation with the at home-workout industry trending into mainstream appeal. Since 2015, there has been a strong shift away from traditional gyms to boot camps and CrossFit, but these still pose the same legacy issues as traditional gyms. The at home fitness industry looks to bridge the gap between traditional gyms and the consumers’ homes. The industry saw considerable growth in 2020 given the pandemic and the subsequent lockdowns that ensued and forced many gym members to look into alternative measures to exercise. It is important to note that overall, the at home gym sub-industry will not revolutionise the fitness industry or cause any significant decline in attendance to traditional gyms in the coming years. They are, however, targeting a niche market that does not want or use all the facilities of a traditional gym and are mainly interested in efficiency, comfort and body toning. Peloton and NLS have both presented data that young females are their main prevailing target market as made evident by proprietary data from both companies.

**Competition**

Nautilus business model currently obtains all its revenue from the sale of hardware equipment, while this is notably changing in the coming years, Technogym and Johnson Healthtech are competitors who also obtain all their revenue from the sale of hardware gym equipment. As made evident by Project North Star, NLS is investing in its subscription-based model to compete with the likes of Peloton, a company with a near-identical business model to the proposed transformed NLS. Thus, making these three companies’ perfectly aligned candidates for analysis. When compared to the relative valuation of its peers, NLS is the clearly undervalued. Investors currently see this industry, and specifically NLS to be reaping the benefits of COVID-19 consumer habits and will thereafter experience sales deflation due to reduced consumption. Previous to 2019 (Pre change of CEO), NLS was a hardware company with no roadmap to transform into a company that aligns with industry trends. Nautilus has been mismanaged historically, and the transformation of NLS does come in the form of a pristine C-Class executive team. An example of the mismanagement was the substantial overvaluation of Octane and the subsequent $70 Million write down in 2019. Given it appears the market is out of favour with the industry, and the new management team is yet to prove themselves, investors believe that NLS will underperform against their projections for the industry. Though with the introduction Project North Star, if management is able to deliver on their guidance and deliver organic growth, NLS is effectively undervalued relative to its peers.

**The Brands**

Nautilus currently has four brands that all receive their revenue from fitness products.

Bowflex:  
Bowlfex is undoubtedly the flagship brand, trusted by consumers for over thirty years. Bowflex produces revenue through two segments; Strength and Cardio. The brands main products are the “Bowflex Max High Intensity Trainer, the innovative Bowflex VeloCore bike, and the patented Bowflex SelectTech dumbbells”. The Bowflex VeloCore Bike is one of the first of its nature (see exhibit 2,3), the flexible nature of the seat allows the consumer to further enhance their experience and therefore increase consumer useability frequency.

Schwinnn:  
Schwinn was an innovator in bringing in the legacy cycling technology as seen in exhibit 5.

JRNY:  
JRNY is Nautilus’ subscription-based workout app. JRNY is now integrated with all major streaming services and on all Nautilus products (exhibit 4) and smartphones. JRNY will be the driving force in the digital revolution of the company.

Nautilus:  
This brand was the original brand that NLS produced but will soon not be a separate brand, but will intergrade into Bowflex and Schwinn.

**The Transformation**

James Barr was appointed CEO in July 2019 and initially made it his first priority to bring in a strong C-Class team to unwind some of the headwinds that previous executives had initiated. There were clear indications of the incompetence of previous management which Mr Barr had highlighted by the immediate changes that he initiated. Shortly into his tenure, Mr Barr initiated the sale of the Octane business, the source of the major write down that materialised in 2019. The second and more indicative of the incompetence was the change of the fiscal year to include the two quarters in which the seasonality of the business enjoys the greatest sales into one fiscal period.

This transformation was not able to be implanted initially due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which had made its way around the world. Project North Star was initiated to introduce the transformation that Mr Barr is implementing to induce growth in the trajectory of the business. Project North Star proposes a 5-year transformation ending in FY2026. The project is built upon 5 pillars, two of which are to be instrumental in achieving the guidance proposed by management. The guidance provided is based upon a 10% 5-year CAGR in which subsequently NLS will achieve $1 billion in revenue of which 20% is attributed to JRNYs subscription model. This should be noted that this margin spread of 80/20 of hardware to subscription is what Peloton is currently achieving. Thus, the margins proposed do seem to be in line with industry trends. Recently, James was able to effectively summarise the project in one sentence; “We are transforming Nautilus from a product-led hardware company to a consumer-led digital company.”

https://preview.redd.it/q4nlf9nhkv181.png?width=404&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0fadd9594412b60bafd79030267babe912238802

&amp;#x200B;

1. Scale Digital Offering

The crown jewel of the transformation is JRNY. A connected fitness, AI-driven, at home personal trainer for the consumer’s every need. Mr Barr has alluded to and communicated that the failure of previous management to enter into the connected fitness industry first could have been the initiation of the failure of Nautilus. NLS has made some very positive and

quick recent acquisitions and partnerships with companies like “VAY” and “FitOn” to ensure that JRNY is able to compete with the likes of One-Peloton. When asked if the capabilities of these companies cannot have been developed internally, James acknowledged that there is nothing that these acquisitions bring that NLS could not have developed internally. But he identified that due to the failure of NLS to enter into the connected fitness industry sooner, the prevailing position of NLS relative to its peers, James indicated that there was no time to waste on internally developing products that can be integrated almost instantly after an acquisition

2. Build Organisational Capabilities

The previous achievements of James in transforming businesses illustrate why this pillar, along with JRNY, are instrumental in the transformation of NLS. Most recently, at Ritchie Bros (RBA, Canada), he was able to hire top C- Class executives and completely change the digital framework of the company, with sales growing 400% in that period. Mr Barr was further able to revolutionise the customer experience digitally and implement a system much similar to the system he is currently envisioning for NLS. Previous to this, James was the Chief Digital Officer for OfficeMax that saw the company ranked 9th in revenues on the Internet Retailer Top 500 list by the end of his tenure. To further illustrate the changes that James is implementing at Nautilus, he has made the following additions:

* Garry R. Wiseman (Chief Digital Officer): Previous role, President of Digital Experience at Dell Computers.
* John R. Goelz (Chief Supply Chain Officer): Previous role, Vice President Global Supply Chain at Master Lock Co.
* Becky L. Alseth (Chief Marketing Officer): Previous role, Senior Vice President Marketing at Avis Rent a Car.
* Aina E. Konold (Chief Financial Officer): Previous role: Vice President Finance at Gap.  
The above 4 changes in executive leadership, bring the change needed to implement North Star and facilitate the guidance given for the transformation.

**Financials**

NLS is positioned well fundamentally and currently posts a strong balance sheet. Financially it’s evident that the industry is seasonal, with the strongest period being the winter months. Worldwide expansion and stability in both the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere will bring stability to the seasonality of revenues and further allow NLS to organically grow. The coefficient of variation for gross margin over the last 5-year period is 0.14, indicating no substantial dispersion, though a steady decline recently due to supply chain constraints. It should be noted that the coefficient of variation for the operating margin is 1.19, indicating substantial variance. This signifies that though the company has been able to manage its supply chain and its pricing power, the large variance in operating margin is indicative of the nature of the competition in the industry. This should be noted that operating margins will continue to come under pressure as the industry becomes more established and more firms come into the industry.

https://preview.redd.it/mp0axc3jkv181.png?width=367&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5387f142c53f34a028ef5f519b161e653a833eba

It is evident that on a relative valuation basis that NLS is trading at a discount historically. Provided management is able to fulfil its plan to transform the business to a subscription-based model, we will begin to see margins elevate. They are currently under pressure due to the supply chain constraints facing the world. This has caused management to heavily invest in their working capital through inventory management and therefore look to fully capitalise on their strong seasons.

NLS has been able to work down the backlog of orders and built a substantial inventory level to not hinder what is usually considered their strong season. Efficiency has been at the forefront of Aina Konold’s recent communications. An increase in the inventory turnover ratio to over 6x in recent quarters (on an LTM basis), when compared to a historical average of 4.1, is largely attributed to this increase in inventory. This is estimated to decline back to historical levels by FY2023. This stacking of inventory could see lower investment into working capital in the coming quarters which could see increases in cash flow from operations.

https://preview.redd.it/yjhru3dkkv181.png?width=222&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d5e548ea74fe6876eaadb16c121228dd6fd1346

*Liquidity*

NLS’ strong balance sheet is enabled by its low total debt and large cash position. The current cash position is 30% of the total market capitalisation of NLS while the Cash/Total Debt ratio is 2x, indicating no immediate short/long term liquidity issues.

Though NLS is not yet earning a material percent of its revenue from their subscription-based product, Peloton is their main competitor for market share. Though PTON has shown similar pricing trends as NLS over the last 6-month period, the financials of the companies are very different. To consider pricing power and the tailwinds of the supply chain issues mentioned by both companies, gross margin comparisons indicate that (June 2021, LTM and December 2020, LTM) NLS dropped 3 percentage points while PTON dropped 4 percentage points to 38.7 and 35.2 respectively. It should also be noted that PTON does have a substantial segment of subscription-based sales which does increase margins when compared to traditional hardware sales. Given that over 95% of all NLS revenue is from hardware sales, their gross margins being indicatively larger does indicate pricing power.

To combat supply chain tailwinds on margins, management has indicated that a decision was made to decrease SG&amp;A which saw a decrease from 23.6% to 20.5% (SG&amp;A to sales) while PTON has shown an increase from 33.5% to 38.4%. To further illustrate the tailwinds that PTON margins are indicating, operating margins increased for NLS while operating margins decreased from positive to negative for PTON. The efficiency of management is further highlighted in the turnover analysis. For the LTM ending June 2021, Inventory turnover remained steady at 6x while PTON decreased from 5.5x to 4.4x. The strategic managerial decision to drastically increase inventory entering into the seasonally busy period to avoid any tailwinds will see these figures increase over the coming months. When compared to PTON, NLS has low levels of leverage with Total Debt/Total Capital for NLS at 17.4% while PTON is 46.3%. When compared to PTON, NLS’ low financial leverage allows them to be flexible in their investment into Project North Star. Given the shift to a more subscription-based revenue model coupled with low financial leverage will allow NLS to reduce operating leverage through the drop in fixed costs.

**Valuation**

The valuation of NLS was completed using a Discounted Cash Flow model as well as a relative valuation.

To effectively value NLS one must capitalise R&amp;D rather than expense the investment. With the shift to a more technological change in the structure of the company, this will become a more prevailing distinguishment between valuations of NLS in the coming years.

Given the conservative nature of the assumptions made with respect to growth, it is evident that there is room for organic development coming out of the pandemic.

Under these assumptions, the intrinsic value calculated for NLS is $28.70 - $34.73.

&amp;#x200B;

**Catalyst**

NLS currently has a high level of short interest, with a reported 15.74% of the float currently held short. The thesis behind these short positions is largely based on the estimated decline in YoY sales. While the run-up earlier in the year could be viewed as premature or based on the temporary change in consumer habits, the fundamentals do indicate potential organic growth. As James has indicated, there is no time for waiting around and creating the technology for JRNY. Thus, NLS will continue to make strategic partnerships and acquire companies to increase their customer base as well as their offering.

With very little debt, cash close to a third of the total market cap and the potential to be a turnaround company, NLS could be viewed as also in a prime position to be bought out. This could be from a competitor or from a new entrant attempting to buy a portfolio of great products at a ‘cheap’ price.

**Risks**

The risks that face Nautilus are sizeable and mainly attributed to macroeconomic factors.

*Consumer trends*

The most profound of any risk that prevails over NLS is the consumer trends for the at home fitness industry. Though the industry has seen unprecedented inorganic growth, only hindsight will indicate the retention that NLS and the industry was able to obtain from this change in environmental and economic factors.

*Supply Chain Constraints*

Though the final goal is for NLS to obtain a material percent of their revenues from subscriptions, they are currently primarily producing the majority of their revenues from the sale of hardware products and thus will continue to see margins swing with supply chain changes. Margins will continue to be under pressure with shipping costs increasing close to 100% YoY.

*North Star progress*

Provided that North Star is the company’s transformation, any subsequent delay or downgrades to the guidance given to the FY2026 timeline will see large volatility in the stock price. Though depending on the weight of the impact, these may be considered short term constraints.

*Capital allocation*

The company has a large cash balance, providing management with a subsequent decision on how to reinvest in the company. Misallocation of cash, could be detrimental to the North Star project and hence cause material deterioration to the company’s financials.

**Conclusion**

Nautilus is currently suffering from previous brand issues and a market assumption on the industry. Though historically, at the right time, investors who were able to identify industry and subsequently companies who are suffering short term headwinds but indicate strong growth long term, are able to capitalise on this.

# Abstract

$NLS

As the world is eyeing the possible end of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is evident that investors currently see the at-home fitness industry as an industry inorganically fuelled by COVID-19 consumer habits. While one may agree with that hypothesis, Nautilus, along with its peers, have dropped circa 70% since their February highs. On an industry basis, investors may be too optimistic about consumer habits and ‘life after COVID’. The world has adapted to a hybrid WFH lifestyle post pandemic and physical exercise also indicates similar trends. The Les Mills October 2021 survey of 13,000 gym consumers worldwide, found that the majority of consumers favour a 60:40 split between gym and at home workouts. While 80% of those surveyed indicated that they plan to continue to use digital workouts post pandemic. This further iterates the total addressable market that JRNY is able to infiltrate and thereafter monetise. Further to that, it was found that digital fitness users’ workout 22% more than live only exercisers, while 84% of gym members continually workout at home also. It is clear that consumer trends are favouring organic growth over the coming years for Nautilus.

**The Industry**

The fitness industry as a whole has been one of very little growth or innovation within the last 2 decades. 2015 saw the first glimpse of innovation with the at home-workout industry trending into mainstream appeal. Since 2015, there has been a strong shift away from traditional gyms to boot camps and CrossFit, but these still pose the same legacy issues as traditional gyms. The at home fitness industry looks to bridge the gap between traditional gyms and the consumers’ homes. The industry saw considerable growth in 2020 given the pandemic and the subsequent lockdowns that ensued and forced many gym members to look into alternative measures to exercise. It is important to note that overall, the at home gym sub-industry will not revolutionise the fitness industry or cause any significant decline in attendance to traditional gyms in the coming years. They are, however, targeting a niche market that does not want or use all the facilities of a traditional gym and are mainly interested in efficiency, comfort and body toning. Peloton and NLS have both presented data that young females are their main prevailing target market as made evident by proprietary data from both companies.

**Competition**

Nautilus business model currently obtains all its revenue from the sale of hardware equipment, while this is notably changing in the coming years, Technogym and Johnson Healthtech are competitors who also obtain all their revenue from the sale of hardware gym equipment. As made evident by Project North Star, NLS is investing in its subscription-based model to compete with the likes of Peloton, a company with a near-identical business model to the proposed transformed NLS. Thus, making these three companies’ perfectly aligned candidates for analysis. When compared to the relative valuation of its peers, NLS is the clearly undervalued. Investors currently see this industry, and specifically NLS to be reaping the benefits of COVID-19 consumer habits and will thereafter experience sales deflation due to reduced consumption. Previous to 2019 (Pre change of CEO), NLS was a hardware company with no roadmap to transform into a company that aligns with industry trends. Nautilus has been mismanaged historically, and the transformation of NLS does come in the form of a pristine C-Class executive team. An example of the mismanagement was the substantial overvaluation of Octane and the subsequent $70 Million write down in 2019. Given it appears the market is out of favour with the industry, and the new management team is yet to prove themselves, investors believe that NLS will underperform against their projections for the industry. Though with the introduction Project North Star, if management is able to deliver on their guidance and deliver organic growth, NLS is effectively undervalued relative to its peers.

**The Brands**

Nautilus currently has four brands that all receive their revenue from fitness products.

Bowflex:  
Bowlfex is undoubtedly the flagship brand, trusted by consumers for over thirty years. Bowflex produces revenue through two segments; Strength and Cardio. The brands main products are the “Bowflex Max High Intensity Trainer, the innovative Bowflex VeloCore bike, and the patented Bowflex SelectTech dumbbells”. The Bowflex VeloCore Bike is one of the first of its nature (see exhibit 2,3), the flexible nature of the seat allows the consumer to further enhance their experience and therefore increase consumer useability frequency.

Schwinnn:  
Schwinn was an innovator in bringing in the legacy cycling technology as seen in exhibit 5.

JRNY:  
JRNY is Nautilus’ subscription-based workout app. JRNY is now integrated with all major streaming services and on all Nautilus products (exhibit 4) and smartphones. JRNY will be the driving force in the digital revolution of the company.

Nautilus:  
This brand was the original brand that NLS produced but will soon not be a separate brand, but will intergrade into Bowflex and Schwinn.

**The Transformation**

James Barr was appointed CEO in July 2019 and initially made it his first priority to bring in a strong C-Class team to unwind some of the headwinds that previous executives had initiated. There were clear indications of the incompetence of previous management which Mr Barr had highlighted by the immediate changes that he initiated. Shortly into his tenure, Mr Barr initiated the sale of the Octane business, the source of the major write down that materialised in 2019. The second and more indicative of the incompetence was the change of the fiscal year to include the two quarters in which the seasonality of the business enjoys the greatest sales into one fiscal period.

This transformation was not able to be implanted initially due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which had made its way around the world. Project North Star was initiated to introduce the transformation that Mr Barr is implementing to induce growth in the trajectory of the business. Project North Star proposes a 5-year transformation ending in FY2026. The project is built upon 5 pillars, two of which are to be instrumental in achieving the guidance proposed by management. The guidance provided is based upon a 10% 5-year CAGR in which subsequently NLS will achieve $1 billion in revenue of which 20% is attributed to JRNYs subscription model. This should be noted that this margin spread of 80/20 of hardware to subscription is what Peloton is currently achieving. Thus, the margins proposed do seem to be in line with industry trends. Recently, James was able to effectively summarise the project in one sentence; “We are transforming Nautilus from a product-led hardware company to a consumer-led digital company.”

https://preview.redd.it/q4nlf9nhkv181.png?width=404&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0fadd9594412b60bafd79030267babe912238802

&amp;#x200B;

1. Scale Digital Offering

The crown jewel of the transformation is JRNY. A connected fitness, AI-driven, at home personal trainer for the consumer’s every need. Mr Barr has alluded to and communicated that the failure of previous management to enter into the connected fitness industry first could have been the initiation of the failure of Nautilus. NLS has made some very positive and

quick recent acquisitions and partnerships with companies like “VAY” and “FitOn” to ensure that JRNY is able to compete with the likes of One-Peloton. When asked if the capabilities of these companies cannot have been developed internally, James acknowledged that there is nothing that these acquisitions bring that NLS could not have developed internally. But he identified that due to the failure of NLS to enter into the connected fitness industry sooner, the prevailing position of NLS relative to its peers, James indicated that there was no time to waste on internally developing products that can be integrated almost instantly after an acquisition

2. Build Organisational Capabilities

The previous achievements of James in transforming businesses illustrate why this pillar, along with JRNY, are instrumental in the transformation of NLS. Most recently, at Ritchie Bros (RBA, Canada), he was able to hire top C- Class executives and completely change the digital framework of the company, with sales growing 400% in that period. Mr Barr was further able to revolutionise the customer experience digitally and implement a system much similar to the system he is currently envisioning for NLS. Previous to this, James was the Chief Digital Officer for OfficeMax that saw the company ranked 9th in revenues on the Internet Retailer Top 500 list by the end of his tenure. To further illustrate the changes that James is implementing at Nautilus, he has made the following additions:

* Garry R. Wiseman (Chief Digital Officer): Previous role, President of Digital Experience at Dell Computers.
* John R. Goelz (Chief Supply Chain Officer): Previous role, Vice President Global Supply Chain at Master Lock Co.
* Becky L. Alseth (Chief Marketing Officer): Previous role, Senior Vice President Marketing at Avis Rent a Car.
* Aina E. Konold (Chief Financial Officer): Previous role: Vice President Finance at Gap.  
The above 4 changes in executive leadership, bring the change needed to implement North Star and facilitate the guidance given for the transformation.

**Financials**

NLS is positioned well fundamentally and currently posts a strong balance sheet. Financially it’s evident that the industry is seasonal, with the strongest period being the winter months. Worldwide expansion and stability in both the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere will bring stability to the seasonality of revenues and further allow NLS to organically grow. The coefficient of variation for gross margin over the last 5-year period is 0.14, indicating no substantial dispersion, though a steady decline recently due to supply chain constraints. It should be noted that the coefficient of variation for the operating margin is 1.19, indicating substantial variance. This signifies that though the company has been able to manage its supply chain and its pricing power, the large variance in operating margin is indicative of the nature of the competition in the industry. This should be noted that operating margins will continue to come under pressure as the industry becomes more established and more firms come into the industry.

https://preview.redd.it/mp0axc3jkv181.png?width=367&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5387f142c53f34a028ef5f519b161e653a833eba

It is evident that on a relative valuation basis that NLS is trading at a discount historically. Provided management is able to fulfil its plan to transform the business to a subscription-based model, we will begin to see margins elevate. They are currently under pressure due to the supply chain constraints facing the world. This has caused management to heavily invest in their working capital through inventory management and therefore look to fully capitalise on their strong seasons.

NLS has been able to work down the backlog of orders and built a substantial inventory level to not hinder what is usually considered their strong season. Efficiency has been at the forefront of Aina Konold’s recent communications. An increase in the inventory turnover ratio to over 6x in recent quarters (on an LTM basis), when compared to a historical average of 4.1, is largely attributed to this increase in inventory. This is estimated to decline back to historical levels by FY2023. This stacking of inventory could see lower investment into working capital in the coming quarters which could see increases in cash flow from operations.

https://preview.redd.it/yjhru3dkkv181.png?width=222&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d5e548ea74fe6876eaadb16c121228dd6fd1346

*Liquidity*

NLS’ strong balance sheet is enabled by its low total debt and large cash position. The current cash position is 30% of the total market capitalisation of NLS while the Cash/Total Debt ratio is 2x, indicating no immediate short/long term liquidity issues.

Though NLS is not yet earning a material percent of its revenue from their subscription-based product, Peloton is their main competitor for market share. Though PTON has shown similar pricing trends as NLS over the last 6-month period, the financials of the companies are very different. To consider pricing power and the tailwinds of the supply chain issues mentioned by both companies, gross margin comparisons indicate that (June 2021, LTM and December 2020, LTM) NLS dropped 3 percentage points while PTON dropped 4 percentage points to 38.7 and 35.2 respectively. It should also be noted that PTON does have a substantial segment of subscription-based sales which does increase margins when compared to traditional hardware sales. Given that over 95% of all NLS revenue is from hardware sales, their gross margins being indicatively larger does indicate pricing power.

To combat supply chain tailwinds on margins, management has indicated that a decision was made to decrease SG&amp;A which saw a decrease from 23.6% to 20.5% (SG&amp;A to sales) while PTON has shown an increase from 33.5% to 38.4%. To further illustrate the tailwinds that PTON margins are indicating, operating margins increased for NLS while operating margins decreased from positive to negative for PTON. The efficiency of management is further highlighted in the turnover analysis. For the LTM ending June 2021, Inventory turnover remained steady at 6x while PTON decreased from 5.5x to 4.4x. The strategic managerial decision to drastically increase inventory entering into the seasonally busy period to avoid any tailwinds will see these figures increase over the coming months. When compared to PTON, NLS has low levels of leverage with Total Debt/Total Capital for NLS at 17.4% while PTON is 46.3%. When compared to PTON, NLS’ low financial leverage allows them to be flexible in their investment into Project North Star. Given the shift to a more subscription-based revenue model coupled with low financial leverage will allow NLS to reduce operating leverage through the drop in fixed costs.

**Valuation**

The valuation of NLS was completed using a Discounted Cash Flow model as well as a relative valuation.

To effectively value NLS one must capitalise R&amp;D rather than expense the investment. With the shift to a more technological change in the structure of the company, this will become a more prevailing distinguishment between valuations of NLS in the coming years.

Given the conservative nature of the assumptions made with respect to growth, it is evident that there is room for organic development coming out of the pandemic.

Under these assumptions, the intrinsic value calculated for NLS is $28.70 - $34.73.

&amp;#x200B;

**Catalyst**

NLS currently has a high level of short interest, with a reported 15.74% of the float currently held short. The thesis behind these short positions is largely based on the estimated decline in YoY sales. While the run-up earlier in the year could be viewed as premature or based on the temporary change in consumer habits, the fundamentals do indicate potential organic growth. As James has indicated, there is no time for waiting around and creating the technology for JRNY. Thus, NLS will continue to make strategic partnerships and acquire companies to increase their customer base as well as their offering.

With very little debt, cash close to a third of the total market cap and the potential to be a turnaround company, NLS could be viewed as also in a prime position to be bought out. This could be from a competitor or from a new entrant attempting to buy a portfolio of great products at a ‘cheap’ price.

**Risks**

The risks that face Nautilus are sizeable and mainly attributed to macroeconomic factors.

*Consumer trends*

The most profound of any risk that prevails over NLS is the consumer trends for the at home fitness industry. Though the industry has seen unprecedented inorganic growth, only hindsight will indicate the retention that NLS and the industry was able to obtain from this change in environmental and economic factors.

*Supply Chain Constraints*

Though the final goal is for NLS to obtain a material percent of their revenues from subscriptions, they are currently primarily producing the majority of their revenues from the sale of hardware products and thus will continue to see margins swing with supply chain changes. Margins will continue to be under pressure with shipping costs increasing close to 100% YoY.

*North Star progress*

Provided that North Star is the company’s transformation, any subsequent delay or downgrades to the guidance given to the FY2026 timeline will see large volatility in the stock price. Though depending on the weight of the impact, these may be considered short term constraints.

*Capital allocation*

The company has a large cash balance, providing management with a subsequent decision on how to reinvest in the company. Misallocation of cash, could be detrimental to the North Star project and hence cause material deterioration to the company’s financials.

**Conclusion**

Nautilus is currently suffering from previous brand issues and a market assumption on the industry. Though historically, at the right time, investors who were able to identify industry and subsequently companies who are suffering short term headwinds but indicate strong growth long term, are able to capitalise on this.

As the world is eyeing the possible end of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is evident that investors currently see the at-home fitness industry as an industry inorganically fuelled by COVID-19 consumer habits. While one may agree with that hypothesis, Nautilus, along with its peers, have dropped circa 70% since their February highs. On an industry basis, investors may be too optimistic about consumer habits and ‘life after COVID’. The world has adapted to a hybrid WFH lifestyle post pandemic and physical exercise also indicates similar trends. The Les Mills October 2021 survey of 13,000 gym consumers worldwide, found that the majority of consumers favour a 60:40 split between gym and at home workouts. While 80% of those surveyed indicated that they plan to continue to use digital workouts post pandemic. This further iterates the total addressable market that JRNY is able to infiltrate and thereafter monetise. Further to that, it was found that digital fitness users’ workout 22% more than live only exercisers, while 84% of gym members continually workout at home also. It is clear that consumer trends are favouring organic growth over the coming years for Nautilus. 

**The Industry** 

The fitness industry as a whole has been one of very little growth or innovation within the last 2 decades. 2015 saw the first glimpse of innovation with the at home-workout industry trending into mainstream appeal. Since 2015, there has been a strong shift away from traditional gyms to boot camps and CrossFit, but these still pose the same legacy issues as traditional gyms. The at home fitness industry looks to bridge the gap between traditional gyms and the consumers’ homes. The industry saw considerable growth in 2020 given the pandemic and the subsequent lockdowns that ensued and forced many gym members to look into alternative measures to exercise. It is important to note that overall, the at home gym sub-industry will not revolutionise the fitness industry or cause any significant decline in attendance to traditional gyms in the coming years. They are, however, targeting a niche market that does not want or use all the facilities of a traditional gym and are mainly interested in efficiency, comfort and body toning. Peloton and NLS have both presented data that young females are their main prevailing target market as made evident by proprietary data from both companies. 

**Competition** 

Nautilus business model currently obtains all its revenue from the sale of hardware equipment, while this is notably changing in the coming years, Technogym and Johnson Healthtech are competitors who also obtain all their revenue from the sale of hardware gym equipment. As made evident by Project North Star, NLS is investing in its subscription-based model to compete with the likes of Peloton, a company with a near-identical business model to the proposed transformed NLS. Thus, making these three companies’ perfectly aligned candidates for analysis. When compared to the relative valuation of its peers, NLS is the clearly undervalued. Investors currently see this industry, and specifically NLS to be reaping the benefits of COVID-19 consumer habits and will thereafter experience sales deflation due to reduced consumption. Previous to 2019 (Pre change of CEO), NLS was a hardware company with no roadmap to transform into a company that aligns with industry trends. Nautilus has been mismanaged historically, and the transformation of NLS does come in the form of a pristine C-Class executive team. An example of the mismanagement was the substantial overvaluation of Octane and the subsequent $70 Million write down in 2019. Given it appears the market is out of favour with the industry, and the new management team is yet to prove themselves, investors believe that NLS will underperform against their projections for the industry. Though with the introduction Project North Star, if management is able to deliver on their guidance and deliver organic growth, NLS is effectively undervalued relative to its peers.

**The Brands** 

Nautilus currently has four brands that all receive their revenue from fitness products. 

Bowflex:  
 Bowlfex is undoubtedly the flagship brand, trusted by consumers for over thirty years. Bowflex produces revenue through two segments; Strength and Cardio. The brands main products are the “Bowflex Max High Intensity Trainer, the innovative Bowflex VeloCore bike, and the patented Bowflex SelectTech dumbbells”. The Bowflex VeloCore Bike is one of the first of its nature (see exhibit 2,3), the flexible nature of the seat allows the consumer to further enhance their experience and therefore increase consumer useability frequency. 

Schwinnn:  
 Schwinn was an innovator in bringing in the legacy cycling technology as seen in exhibit 5. 

JRNY:  
 JRNY is Nautilus’ subscription-based workout app. JRNY is now integrated with all major streaming services and on all Nautilus products (exhibit 4) and smartphones. JRNY will be the driving force in the digital revolution of the company. 

Nautilus:  
 This brand was the original brand that NLS produced but will soon not be a separate brand, but will intergrade into Bowflex and Schwinn.

**The Transformation** 

James Barr was appointed CEO in July 2019 and initially made it his first priority to bring in a strong C-Class team to unwind some of the headwinds that previous executives had initiated. There were clear indications of the incompetence of previous management which Mr Barr had highlighted by the immediate changes that he initiated. Shortly into his tenure, Mr Barr initiated the sale of the Octane business, the source of the major write down that materialised in 2019. The second and more indicative of the incompetence was the change of the fiscal year to include the two quarters in which the seasonality of the business enjoys the greatest sales into one fiscal period. 

This transformation was not able to be implanted initially due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which had made its way around the world. Project North Star was initiated to introduce the transformation that Mr Barr is implementing to induce growth in the trajectory of the business. Project North Star proposes a 5-year transformation ending in FY2026. The project is built upon 5 pillars, two of which are to be instrumental in achieving the guidance proposed by management. The guidance provided is based upon a 10% 5-year CAGR in which subsequently NLS will achieve $1 billion in revenue of which 20% is attributed to JRNYs subscription model. This should be noted that this margin spread of 80/20 of hardware to subscription is what Peloton is currently achieving. Thus, the margins proposed do seem to be in line with industry trends. Recently, James was able to effectively summarise the project in one sentence;  “We are transforming Nautilus from a product-led hardware company to a consumer-led digital company.”

1. Scale Digital Offering 

The crown jewel of the transformation is JRNY. A connected fitness, AI-driven, at home personal trainer for the consumer’s every need. Mr Barr has alluded to and communicated that the failure of previous management to enter into the connected fitness industry first could have been the initiation of the failure of Nautilus. NLS has made some very positive and 

quick recent acquisitions and partnerships with companies like “VAY” and “FitOn” to ensure that JRNY is able to compete with the likes of One-Peloton. When asked if the capabilities of these companies cannot have been developed internally, James acknowledged that there is nothing that these acquisitions bring that NLS could not have developed internally. But he identified that due to the failure of NLS to enter into the connected fitness industry sooner, the prevailing position of NLS relative to its peers, James indicated that there was no time to waste on internally developing products that can be integrated almost instantly after an acquisition 

2. Build Organisational Capabilities 

The previous achievements of James in transforming businesses illustrate why this pillar, along with JRNY, are instrumental in the transformation of NLS. Most recently, at Ritchie Bros (RBA, Canada), he was able to hire top C- Class executives and completely change the digital framework of the company, with sales growing 400% in that period. Mr Barr was further able to revolutionise the customer experience digitally and implement a system much similar to the system he is currently envisioning for NLS. Previous to this, James was the Chief Digital Officer for OfficeMax that saw the company ranked 9th in revenues on the Internet Retailer Top 500 list by the end of his tenure. To further illustrate the changes that James is implementing at Nautilus, he has made the following additions: 

* Garry R. Wiseman (Chief Digital Officer): Previous role, President of Digital Experience at Dell Computers. 
* John R. Goelz (Chief Supply Chain Officer): Previous role, Vice President Global Supply Chain at Master Lock Co. 
* Becky L. Alseth (Chief Marketing Officer): Previous role, Senior Vice President Marketing at Avis Rent a Car.
* Aina E. Konold (Chief Financial Officer): Previous role: Vice President Finance at Gap.   
 The above 4 changes in executive leadership, bring the change needed to implement North Star and facilitate the guidance given for the transformation. 

**Financials**

NLS is positioned well fundamentally and currently posts a strong balance sheet. Financially it’s evident that the industry is seasonal, with the strongest period being the winter months. Worldwide expansion and stability in both the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere will bring stability to the seasonality of revenues and further allow NLS to organically grow. The coefficient of variation for gross margin over the last 5-year period is 0.14, indicating no substantial dispersion, though a steady decline recently due to supply chain constraints. It should be noted that the coefficient of variation for the operating margin is 1.19, indicating substantial variance. This signifies that though the company has been able to manage its supply chain and its pricing power, the large variance in operating margin is indicative of the nature of the competition in the industry. This should be noted that operating margins will continue to come under pressure as the industry becomes more established and more firms come into the industry. 

&amp;#x200B;

[     ](https://preview.redd.it/9bdbb85cgv181.png?width=369&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed500d950d84e41b4189ffd910a138408a790d10)

It is evident that on a relative valuation basis that NLS is trading at a discount historically. Provided management is able to fulfil its plan to transform the business to a subscription-based model, we will begin to see margins elevate. They are currently under pressure due to the supply chain constraints facing the world. This has caused management to heavily invest in their working capital through inventory management and therefore look to fully capitalise on their strong seasons. 

NLS has been able to work down the backlog of orders and built a substantial inventory level to not hinder what is usually considered their strong season. Efficiency has been at the forefront of Aina Konold’s recent communications. An increase in the inventory turnover ratio to over 6x in recent quarters (on an LTM basis), when compared to a historical average of 4.1, is largely attributed to this increase in inventory. This is estimated to decline back to historical levels by FY2023. This stacking of inventory could see lower investment into working capital in the coming quarters which could see increases in cash flow from operations.

*Liquidity* 

NLS’ strong balance sheet is enabled by its low total debt and large cash position. The current cash position is 30% of the total market capitalisation of NLS while the Cash/Total Debt ratio is 2x, indicating no immediate short/long term liquidity issues. 

Though NLS is not yet earning a material percent of its revenue from their subscription-based product, Peloton is their main competitor for market share. Though PTON has shown similar pricing trends as NLS over the last 6-month period, the financials of the companies are very different. To consider pricing power and the tailwinds of the supply chain issues mentioned by both companies, gross margin comparisons indicate that (June 2021, LTM and December 2020, LTM) NLS dropped 3 percentage points while PTON dropped 4 percentage points to 38.7 and 35.2 respectively. It should also be noted that PTON does have a substantial segment of subscription-based sales which does increase margins when compared to traditional hardware sales. Given that over 95% of all NLS revenue is from hardware sales, their gross margins being indicatively larger does indicate pricing power. 

To combat supply chain tailwinds on margins, management has indicated that a decision was made to decrease SG&amp;A which saw a decrease from 23.6% to 20.5% (SG&amp;A to sales) while PTON has shown an increase from 33.5% to 38.4%. To further illustrate the tailwinds that PTON margins are indicating, operating margins increased for NLS while operating margins decreased from positive to negative for PTON. The efficiency of management is further highlighted in the turnover analysis. For the LTM ending June 2021, Inventory turnover remained steady at 6x while PTON decreased from 5.5x to 4.4x. The strategic managerial decision to drastically increase inventory entering into the seasonally busy period to avoid any tailwinds will see these figures increase over the coming months. When compared to PTON, NLS has low levels of leverage with Total Debt/Total Capital for NLS at 17.4% while PTON is 46.3%. When compared to PTON, NLS’ low financial leverage allows them to be flexible in their investment into Project North Star. Given the shift to a more subscription-based revenue model coupled with low financial leverage will allow NLS to reduce operating leverage through the drop in fixed costs.

**Valuation** 

The valuation of NLS was completed using a Discounted Cash Flow model as well as a relative valuation. 

To effectively value NLS one must capitalise R&amp;D rather than expense the investment. With the shift to a more technological change in the structure of the company, this will become a more prevailing distinguishment between valuations of NLS in the coming years. 

Given the conservative nature of the assumptions made with respect to growth, it is evident that there is room for organic development coming out of the pandemic. 

Under these assumptions, the intrinsic value calculated for NLS is $28.70 - $34.73. 

https://preview.redd.it/w0w9br4lgv181.png?width=221&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46a1194205ae6271b9c182b5bf0e611b768f9b5e

**Catalyst** 

NLS currently has a high level of short interest, with a reported 15.74% of the float currently held short. The thesis behind these short positions is largely based on the estimated decline in YoY sales. While the run-up earlier in the year could be viewed as premature or based on the temporary change in consumer habits, the fundamentals do indicate potential organic growth. As James has indicated, there is no time for waiting around and creating the technology for JRNY. Thus, NLS will continue to make strategic partnerships and acquire companies to increase their customer base as well as their offering. 

With very little debt, cash close to a third of the total market cap and the potential to be a turnaround company, NLS could be viewed as also in a prime position to be bought out. This could be from a competitor or from a new entrant attempting to buy a portfolio of great products at a ‘cheap’ price. 

**Risks** 

The risks that face Nautilus are sizeable and mainly attributed to macroeconomic factors. 

*Consumer trends* 

The most profound of any risk that prevails over NLS is the consumer trends for the at home fitness industry. Though the industry has seen unprecedented inorganic growth, only hindsight will indicate the retention that NLS and the industry was able to obtain from this change in environmental and economic factors. 

*Supply Chain Constraints* 

Though the final goal is for NLS to obtain a material percent of their revenues from subscriptions, they are currently primarily producing the majority of their revenues from the sale of hardware products and thus will continue to see margins swing with supply chain changes. Margins will continue to be under pressure with shipping costs increasing close to 100% YoY. 

*North Star progress* 

Provided that North Star is the company’s transformation, any subsequent delay or downgrades to the guidance given to the FY2026 timeline will see large volatility in the stock price. Though depending on the weight of the impact, these may be considered short term constraints. 

*Capital allocation* 

The company has a large cash balance, providing management with a subsequent decision on how to reinvest in the company. Misallocation of cash, could be detrimental to the North Star project and hence cause material deterioration to the company’s financials. 

**Conclusion** 

Nautilus is currently suffering from previous brand issues and a market assumption on the industry. Though historically, at the right time, investors who were able to identify industry and subsequently companies who are suffering short term headwinds but indicate strong growth long term, are able to capitalise on this.

Not advice.",Nautilus (NLS) - Deep Value Tendies Opp (&gt;100% potential),1,1,"Nautilus (NLS) - Deep Value Tendies Opp (&gt;100% potential) #      Abstract

As the world is eyeing the possible end of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is evident that investors currently see the at-home fitness industry as an industry inorganically fuelled by COVID-19 consumer habits. While one may agree with that hypothesis, Nautilus, along with its peers, have dropped circa 70% since their February highs. On an industry basis, investors may be too optimistic about consumer habits and ‘life after COVID’. The world has adapted to a hybrid WFH lifestyle post pandemic and physical exercise also indicates similar trends. The Les Mills October 2021 survey of 13,000 gym consumers worldwide, found that the majority of consumers favour a 60:40 split between gym and at home workouts. While 80% of those surveyed indicated that they plan to continue to use digital workouts post pandemic. This further iterates the total addressable market that JRNY is able to infiltrate and thereafter monetise. Further to that, it was found that digital fitness users’ workout 22% more than live only exercisers, while 84% of gym members continually workout at home also. It is clear that consumer trends are favouring organic growth over the coming years for Nautilus. 

**The Industry** 

The fitness industry as a whole has been one of very little growth or innovation within the last 2 decades. 2015 saw the first glimpse of innovation with the at home-workout industry trending into mainstream appeal. Since 2015, there has been a strong shift away from traditional gyms to boot camps and CrossFit, but these still pose the same legacy issues as traditional gyms. The at home fitness industry looks to bridge the gap between traditional gyms and the consumers’ homes. The industry saw considerable growth in 2020 given the pandemic and the subsequent lockdowns that ensued and forced many gym members to look into alternative measures to exercise. It is important to note that overall, the at home gym sub-industry will not revolutionise the fitness industry or cause any significant decline in attendance to traditional gyms in the coming years. They are, however, targeting a niche market that does not want or use all the facilities of a traditional gym and are mainly interested in efficiency, comfort and body toning. Peloton and NLS have both presented data that young females are their main prevailing target market as made evident by proprietary data from both companies. 

**Competition** 

Nautilus business model currently obtains all its revenue from the sale of hardware equipment, while this is notably changing in the coming years, Technogym and Johnson Healthtech are competitors who also obtain all their revenue from the sale of hardware gym equipment. As made evident by Project North Star, NLS is investing in its subscription-based model to compete with the likes of Peloton, a company with a near-identical business model to the proposed transformed NLS. Thus, making these three companies’ perfectly aligned candidates for analysis. When compared to the relative valuation of its peers, NLS is the clearly undervalued. Investors currently see this industry, and specifically NLS to be reaping the benefits of COVID-19 consumer habits and will thereafter experience sales deflation due to reduced consumption. Previous to 2019 (Pre change of CEO), NLS was a hardware company with no roadmap to transform into a company that aligns with industry trends. Nautilus has been mismanaged historically, and the transformation of NLS does come in the form of a pristine C-Class executive team. An example of the mismanagement was the substantial overvaluation of Octane and the subsequent $70 Million write down in 2019. Given it appears the market is out of favour with the industry, and the new management team is yet to prove themselves, investors believe that NLS will underperform against their projections for the industry. Though with the introduction Project North Star, if management is able to deliver on their guidance and deliver organic growth, NLS is effectively undervalued relative to its peers.

**The Brands** 

Nautilus currently has four brands that all receive their revenue from fitness products. 

Bowflex:  
 Bowlfex is undoubtedly the flagship brand, trusted by consumers for over thirty years. Bowflex produces revenue through two segments; Strength and Cardio. The brands main products are the “Bowflex Max High Intensity Trainer, the innovative Bowflex VeloCore bike, and the patented Bowflex SelectTech dumbbells”. The Bowflex VeloCore Bike is one of the first of its nature (see exhibit 2,3), the flexible nature of the seat allows the consumer to further enhance their experience and therefore increase consumer useability frequency. 

Schwinnn:  
 Schwinn was an innovator in bringing in the legacy cycling technology as seen in exhibit 5. 

JRNY:  
 JRNY is Nautilus’ subscription-based workout app. JRNY is now integrated with all major streaming services and on all Nautilus products (exhibit 4) and smartphones. JRNY will be the driving force in the digital revolution of the company. 

Nautilus:  
 This brand was the original brand that NLS produced but will soon not be a separate brand, but will intergrade into Bowflex and Schwinn.

**The Transformation** 

James Barr was appointed CEO in July 2019 and initially made it his first priority to bring in a strong C-Class team to unwind some of the headwinds that previous executives had initiated. There were clear indications of the incompetence of previous management which Mr Barr had highlighted by the immediate changes that he initiated. Shortly into his tenure, Mr Barr initiated the sale of the Octane business, the source of the major write down that materialised in 2019. The second and more indicative of the incompetence was the change of the fiscal year to include the two quarters in which the seasonality of the business enjoys the greatest sales into one fiscal period. 

This transformation was not able to be implanted initially due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which had made its way around the world. Project North Star was initiated to introduce the transformation that Mr Barr is implementing to induce growth in the trajectory of the business. Project North Star proposes a 5-year transformation ending in FY2026. The project is built upon 5 pillars, two of which are to be instrumental in achieving the guidance proposed by management. The guidance provided is based upon a 10% 5-year CAGR in which subsequently NLS will achieve $1 billion in revenue of which 20% is attributed to JRNYs subscription model. This should be noted that this margin spread of 80/20 of hardware to subscription is what Peloton is currently achieving. Thus, the margins proposed do seem to be in line with industry trends. Recently, James was able to effectively summarise the project in one sentence;  “We are transforming Nautilus from a product-led hardware company to a consumer-led digital company.” 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3oey3eo6gv181.png?width=404&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1958a4bf9bbe9cafe16d0351cdb5108ca7965e71

1. Scale Digital Offering 

The crown jewel of the transformation is JRNY. A connected fitness, AI-driven, at home personal trainer for the consumer’s every need. Mr Barr has alluded to and communicated that the failure of previous management to enter into the connected fitness industry first could have been the initiation of the failure of Nautilus. NLS has made some very positive and 

quick recent acquisitions and partnerships with companies like “VAY” and “FitOn” to ensure that JRNY is able to compete with the likes of One-Peloton. When asked if the capabilities of these companies cannot have been developed internally, James acknowledged that there is nothing that these acquisitions bring that NLS could not have developed internally. But he identified that due to the failure of NLS to enter into the connected fitness industry sooner, the prevailing position of NLS relative to its peers, James indicated that there was no time to waste on internally developing products that can be integrated almost instantly after an acquisition 

2. Build Organisational Capabilities 

The previous achievements of James in transforming businesses illustrate why this pillar, along with JRNY, are instrumental in the transformation of NLS. Most recently, at Ritchie Bros (RBA, Canada), he was able to hire top C- Class executives and completely change the digital framework of the company, with sales growing 400% in that period. Mr Barr was further able to revolutionise the customer experience digitally and implement a system much similar to the system he is currently envisioning for NLS. Previous to this, James was the Chief Digital Officer for OfficeMax that saw the company ranked 9th in revenues on the Internet Retailer Top 500 list by the end of his tenure. To further illustrate the changes that James is implementing at Nautilus, he has made the following additions: 

* Garry R. Wiseman (Chief Digital Officer): Previous role, President of Digital Experience at Dell Computers. 
* John R. Goelz (Chief Supply Chain Officer): Previous role, Vice President Global Supply Chain at Master Lock Co. 
* Becky L. Alseth (Chief Marketing Officer): Previous role, Senior Vice President Marketing at Avis Rent a Car.
* Aina E. Konold (Chief Financial Officer): Previous role: Vice President Finance at Gap.   
 The above 4 changes in executive leadership, bring the change needed to implement North Star and facilitate the guidance given for the transformation. 

**Financials**

NLS is positioned well fundamentally and currently posts a strong balance sheet. Financially it’s evident that the industry is seasonal, with the strongest period being the winter months. Worldwide expansion and stability in both the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere will bring stability to the seasonality of revenues and further allow NLS to organically grow. The coefficient of variation for gross margin over the last 5-year period is 0.14, indicating no substantial dispersion, though a steady decline recently due to supply chain constraints. It should be noted that the coefficient of variation for the operating margin is 1.19, indicating substantial variance. This signifies that though the company has been able to manage its supply chain and its pricing power, the large variance in operating margin is indicative of the nature of the competition in the industry. This should be noted that operating margins will continue to come under pressure as the industry becomes more established and more firms come into the industry. 

&amp;#x200B;

[     ](https://preview.redd.it/9bdbb85cgv181.png?width=369&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed500d950d84e41b4189ffd910a138408a790d10)

It is evident that on a relative valuation basis that NLS is trading at a discount historically. Provided management is able to fulfil its plan to transform the business to a subscription-based model, we will begin to see margins elevate. They are currently under pressure due to the supply chain constraints facing the world. This has caused management to heavily invest in their working capital through inventory management and therefore look to fully capitalise on their strong seasons. 

NLS has been able to work down the backlog of orders and built a substantial inventory level to not hinder what is usually considered their strong season. Efficiency has been at the forefront of Aina Konold’s recent communications. An increase in the inventory turnover ratio to over 6x in recent quarters (on an LTM basis), when compared to a historical average of 4.1, is largely attributed to this increase in inventory. This is estimated to decline back to historical levels by FY2023. This stacking of inventory could see lower investment into working capital in the coming quarters which could see increases in cash flow from operations.

*Liquidity* 

NLS’ strong balance sheet is enabled by its low total debt and large cash position. The current cash position is 30% of the total market capitalisation of NLS while the Cash/Total Debt ratio is 2x, indicating no immediate short/long term liquidity issues. 

Though NLS is not yet earning a material percent of its revenue from their subscription-based product, Peloton is their main competitor for market share. Though PTON has shown similar pricing trends as NLS over the last 6-month period, the financials of the companies are very different. To consider pricing power and the tailwinds of the supply chain issues mentioned by both companies, gross margin comparisons indicate that (June 2021, LTM and December 2020, LTM) NLS dropped 3 percentage points while PTON dropped 4 percentage points to 38.7 and 35.2 respectively. It should also be noted that PTON does have a substantial segment of subscription-based sales which does increase margins when compared to traditional hardware sales. Given that over 95% of all NLS revenue is from hardware sales, their gross margins being indicatively larger does indicate pricing power. 

To combat supply chain tailwinds on margins, management has indicated that a decision was made to decrease SG&amp;A which saw a decrease from 23.6% to 20.5% (SG&amp;A to sales) while PTON has shown an increase from 33.5% to 38.4%. To further illustrate the tailwinds that PTON margins are indicating, operating margins increased for NLS while operating margins decreased from positive to negative for PTON. The efficiency of management is further highlighted in the turnover analysis. For the LTM ending June 2021, Inventory turnover remained steady at 6x while PTON decreased from 5.5x to 4.4x. The strategic managerial decision to drastically increase inventory entering into the seasonally busy period to avoid any tailwinds will see these figures increase over the coming months. When compared to PTON, NLS has low levels of leverage with Total Debt/Total Capital for NLS at 17.4% while PTON is 46.3%. When compared to PTON, NLS’ low financial leverage allows them to be flexible in their investment into Project North Star. Given the shift to a more subscription-based revenue model coupled with low financial leverage will allow NLS to reduce operating leverage through the drop in fixed costs.

**Valuation** 

The valuation of NLS was completed using a Discounted Cash Flow model as well as a relative valuation. 

To effectively value NLS one must capitalise R&amp;D rather than expense the investment. With the shift to a more technological change in the structure of the company, this will become a more prevailing distinguishment between valuations of NLS in the coming years. 

Given the conservative nature of the assumptions made with respect to growth, it is evident that there is room for organic development coming out of the pandemic. 

Under these assumptions, the intrinsic value calculated for NLS is $28.70 - $34.73.

**Catalyst** 

NLS currently has a high level of short interest, with a reported 15.74% of the float currently held short. The thesis behind these short positions is largely based on the estimated decline in YoY sales. While the run-up earlier in the year could be viewed as premature or based on the temporary change in consumer habits, the fundamentals do indicate potential organic growth. As James has indicated, there is no time for waiting around and creating the technology for JRNY. Thus, NLS will continue to make strategic partnerships and acquire companies to increase their customer base as well as their offering. 

With very little debt, cash close to a third of the total market cap and the potential to be a turnaround company, NLS could be viewed as also in a prime position to be bought out. This could be from a competitor or from a new entrant attempting to buy a portfolio of great products at a ‘cheap’ price. 

**Risks** 

The risks that face Nautilus are sizeable and mainly attributed to macroeconomic factors. 

*Consumer trends* 

The most profound of any risk that prevails over NLS is the consumer trends for the at home fitness industry. Though the industry has seen unprecedented inorganic growth, only hindsight will indicate the retention that NLS and the industry was able to obtain from this change in environmental and economic factors. 

*Supply Chain Constraints* 

Though the final goal is for NLS to obtain a material percent of their revenues from subscriptions, they are currently primarily producing the majority of their revenues from the sale of hardware products and thus will continue to see margins swing with supply chain changes. Margins will continue to be under pressure with shipping costs increasing close to 100% YoY. 

*North Star progress* 

Provided that North Star is the company’s transformation, any subsequent delay or downgrades to the guidance given to the FY2026 timeline will see large volatility in the stock price. Though depending on the weight of the impact, these may be considered short term constraints. 

*Capital allocation* 

The company has a large cash balance, providing management with a subsequent decision on how to reinvest in the company. Misallocation of cash, could be detrimental to the North Star project and hence cause material deterioration to the company’s financials. 

**Conclusion** 

Nautilus is currently suffering from previous brand issues and a market assumption on the industry. Though historically, at the right time, investors who were able to identify industry and subsequently companies who are suffering short term headwinds but indicate strong growth long term, are able to capitalise on this.

So pretty much the company has developed a way to administer drugs orally without the need for injections. This is obviously useful for any drug compatible with the capsule format and is beneficial to anyone who prefers orally taking drugs due to fear of needles, etc. BUT THIS ISNT WHY RANI WILL FLY. KEEP READING TO SEE THE NICE LITTLE SQUEEZE THAT IS POSSIBLE.📷

Have you ever had one of those light bulb moments where it all makes sense? We have seen GME, AMC, ISIG, DWAC and others run to the moon and back. Well let me tell you the next runner. The ticker is RANI. Now, you are you are probably thinking why the fuck would I invest in this random ass biotech company. Listen to me…..I understand that Bio techs are a wild ride but after the evidence I present I think this could be and easy 100% runner. The analyst already have this ticker priced at 24-28 dollars a share. If you made it this far then buckle up for some no bullshit mind fucking blowing DD.

First off this ticker currently sits at around 200 on Fintels’ short list. This does not seem high on the list but wait until I give you some examples of recent tickers that sat same on the list then flew up to number 1 and 2. 📷

I am using the same method when I found ISIG after being shorted to shit as well as EFOI AT EXCATLY THE SAME SPOT ON THE LIST TWO WEEKS BEFORE TAKE OFF. If this runs I will be sure to release my technique on how to find these runners. So, first off lets take a look at the borrow rate. It is currently at a RIDICULOUS AS FUCK 142%.📷

Now, why would the borrow fee be so high when the “short interest” is so low? As with anything loaned out if the risk is high the fee is high. In other words, the true short interest has not shown yet due to the delay in reporting. We know that short interest is reported at the end and middle of every month. The ending numbers for December were not reported. So, I expect to see some outrageous numbers during Mid-January. After the stock was reported on 12-15 it ran over 20 dollars and you know damn well these shorts were loving the entry for their short position. However, there is plenty of room for a reversal seeing as the price was over 35 dollars in November and the FLOAT IS ONLY 7 MILLION WITH 4O FUCKING THOUSAND AVERAGE DAILY VOLUME. YES ONLY 40K A DAY. IMAGINE MAKING 40K OFF A 40K AVERAGE DAILY VOLUME TICKER.

📷 This leads me the my next piece of evidence. We have seen a significant increase in short volume within the dark pool which is another indicator that the whales are having a field day with this low float bio tech. 📷

Lastly HERE COMES THE BEST PART. **HARDLY ANY SHARES TO SHORT THIS STOCK.** 📷

So, with any uptick in volume the shorts will be shitting their pants waiting to see how high it goes before they have to start covering. To conclude, the company has a decent amount of cash on hand and no signs of dilution in the future seeing as they raised 42 million for their IPO back in August.

**DON’T LET THIS DD GO TO SHAMBLES. QUIT BEING A CUCK AND TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE WITH THIS OPPORTUNITY.**

**I am not a financial advisor and these are my opinion. Do not buy based on my suggestions and do your own DD. I am only stating research I found.**

Both NCLH and CCL are near bottoms even including during the initial pandemic price drops. Both have been 30% higher within the last 90 days and dropped due to recent Omicron outbreak leaving current prices below 2020 lows.

Days to cover on both stocks are sub 2 days to cover with significant short interest and ""dark pool shorts"" greater than 50%

Last week (Thusday) appeared to be a dry run for upcoming short squeeze with options prices into January 2023 being extremely low (see Jan2020 20 calls $2-4/option) and both NCLH and CCL jumping 9-10% respectively.

When Omicron or other positive news comes in, we should expect to see large upswings in equity prices including mass covering of shorts driving the price higher.

# Company Description

Groupon operates an online marketplace for deals on local goods, services, travel, and attractions. Revenue is driven by commissions from sellers, with 60% of gross sales coming from North America. The company also has substantial holdings in equity investments, with their SumUp (fintech) assets estimated at approx $500m alone (current GRPN mkt cap \~$640m). The company brought on the former Zappos CEO as a permanent CEO in 4Q21, replacing the interim CEO.

# Thesis

GRPN shares are severely undervalued, especially when accounting for equity investments in Sum-Up (valued at approx $18/GRPN). Ex-investments, GRPN's operating business is currently valued at a **Fwd P/E 1.55**, **Fwd PEG of 0.038**, and **Fwd P/S of 0.12**; in its entirety (inc. investments), GRPN is valued at Fwd P/E 10.9, Fwd PEG 0.267, and Fwd P/S of 0.68, still insanely good. For comparison, Peabody Energy (ticker BTU, a US coal company) currently trades at a Fwd P/E of 6.36 and Fwd P/S of 0.54. Fundamentally, this company screens extremely well.

Like many companies, GRPN initiated a strategy shift and **cost restructuring starting in 2020** (with related impairments occurring through 4Q21) that is finally **nearing an inflection point** for their business rebound. Despite impairments ending in 2021, the company is expected to continue realizing an additional $225m in cost savings in 2022. Coincidentally, this is also occurring as covid restrictions are easing. Both the restructuring and the ""post-covid normalization"" are intersecting at the perfect moment to **supercharge the company's profitability** as Americans return to activities outside the home and merchants return to the platform.

Additionally, they revised their accounting methods in 2020 to better account for their goods strategy which has been a drag on revenue comps in 2021, but will normalize in 2022 as it laps quarters since the change was implemented.

In Q3, the company also entered new partnerships with Google Pay and Square for distribution of inventory, a major win in increasing their audience that will help drive increasing volume.

The company just brought on a new CEO, Kedar Deshpande (former CEO of Zappos), and it's possible that he resets financials. However, I'd assign a low probability to this given that financials have already been reset over the restructuring period.

It's also worth noting that GRPN has a strong record of surpassing analyst estimates over the covid period, and as long as analysts stay cautiously optimistic, they're likely set up to continue leaping over the low bar. Given how depressed estimates are, this may allow them to overcome a key risk that earnings may be volatile following the Omicron surge in Dec-Jan in the US, though this may be neutralized by guidance commentary as the surge is a month behind us and there is likely more clarity on the road ahead.

There is also a high short interest on GRPN stock (\~19% of float) that has lazily remained in the stock as a short momentum play. Given this type of inflection point for the underlying business combined with the current market environment leading HFs to crowd into shorts, a strong rally on GRPN fundamentals from here would likely lead to an acceleration of short covering, driving the stock closer to fair value in a relatively short amount of time.

Tldr: GRPN severely undervalued, has a ton of hidden value from investments, and is at a key inflection point exiting a restructuring at the same time that demand should flow back to the platform. Sentiment is still cautious enough to create a phenomenal entry point, while short interest is extremely high, creating a potential short cover as lazy momentum shorts unwind.

# Current Valuation &amp; Financials

Fwd P/S ’22: 0.67

Revenue Growth Est: 0% '22, 7% '23

* Revenue is expected to stabilize in 2022, though I suspect this is a great setup for continued upside surprises, boosted by the Things to Do and Beauty Goods verticals that are leveraged to easing covid restrictions.

Fwd P/E 10.9

EPS Growth Est: +41% '22

* EPS expected to inflect higher as cost restructuring gains take hold and revenue stabilizes &amp; accelerates as the world reopens post-covid and merchants return to the platform.

Fwd EV/EBITDA: 3.05

EBITDA Growth Est: 27% '22, 13% '23

* Strong EBITDA growth a direct result of cost restructuring and continued cost improvements. GRPN has used the pandemic crisis to shift strategies and drastically improve efficiency of operations and profitability.

Free Cash Flow Generation: +140% YoY '22

* FCF is expected to turn positive in '22 for the first time since 2019. GRPN currently trades at a 12% Fwd FCF Yield, very high for a growth stock inflecting to reaccelerate revenues. 4Q21 FCF is expected to grow at 290% YoY, with 1Q22 expected to be the first decisively positive FCF Q1 ever.

Equity Investments

* Equity investments are the 1000lb elephant in the room. The latest earnings report revalued LT investments at $123m on the balance sheet, though in Jan 2022, it was reported that SumUp (of which GRPN own's 2.4%) was preparing to raise an funding round at a $22bil valuation. If successful at this valuation, their equity position in Sumup would equate to approx 528m, increasing their investments by over 4x. In turn, their balance sheet equity would actually equate to a higher total value than their current market cap.

Analyst Price Target: $37, +67.6% upside

* Analysts have gone stale, with 60% of PTs updated prior to 2022. By leaving GRPN in the cold on updates to institutional investors, this has created opportunities once the company reports on Feb 28 for models to be revised higher and sell-side sentiment to suddenly become more optimistic given the current inflection point.  

   * Barclays stated valuation is currently ""rock bottom"" and expects the marketing strategy to generate growth near term, though is waiting for confirmation of continued momentum before upgrading the stock from underweight.
   * JPMorgan is also cautiously optimistic that the 2020-21 restructuring efforts are about to pay off through higher growth and a more profitable business.
* A recent report by Prescience Point Capital Mgmt established a longer-term fair value range of $69-100+ when accounting for the operating business and investments.

# Company Description

Groupon operates an online marketplace for deals on local goods, services, travel, and attractions. Revenue is driven by commissions from sellers, with 60% of gross sales coming from North America. The company also has substantial holdings in equity investments, with their SumUp (fintech) assets estimated at approx $500m alone (current GRPN mkt cap \~$640m). The company brought on the former Zappos CEO as a permanent CEO in 4Q21, replacing the interim CEO.

# Thesis

GRPN shares are severely undervalued, especially when accounting for equity investments in Sum-Up (valued at approx $18/GRPN). Ex-investments, GRPN's operating business is currently valued at a **Fwd P/E 1.55**, **Fwd PEG of 0.038**, and **Fwd P/S of 0.12**; in its entirety (inc. investments), GRPN is valued at Fwd P/E 10.9, Fwd PEG 0.267, and Fwd P/S of 0.68, still insanely good. For comparison, Peabody Energy (ticker BTU, a US coal company) currently trades at a Fwd P/E of 6.36 and Fwd P/S of 0.54. Fundamentally, this company screens extremely well.

Like many companies, GRPN initiated a strategy shift and **cost restructuring starting in 2020** (with related impairments occurring through 4Q21) that is finally **nearing an inflection point** for their business rebound. Despite impairments ending in 2021, the company is expected to continue realizing an additional $225m in cost savings in 2022. Coincidentally, this is also occurring as covid restrictions are easing. Both the restructuring and the ""post-covid normalization"" are intersecting at the perfect moment to **supercharge the company's profitability** as Americans return to activities outside the home and merchants return to the platform.

Additionally, they revised their accounting methods in 2020 to better account for their goods strategy which has been a drag on revenue comps in 2021, but will normalize in 2022 as it laps quarters since the change was implemented.

In Q3, the company also entered new partnerships with Google Pay and Square for distribution of inventory, a major win in increasing their audience that will help drive increasing volume.

The company just brought on a new CEO, Kedar Deshpande (former CEO of Zappos), and it's possible that he resets financials. However, I'd assign a low probability to this given that financials have already been reset over the restructuring period.

It's also worth noting that GRPN has a strong record of surpassing analyst estimates over the covid period, and as long as analysts stay cautiously optimistic, they're likely set up to continue leaping over the low bar. Given how depressed estimates are, this may allow them to overcome a key risk that earnings may be volatile following the Omicron surge in Dec-Jan in the US, though this may be neutralized by guidance commentary as the surge is a month behind us and there is likely more clarity on the road ahead.

There is also a high short interest on GRPN stock (\~19% of float) that has lazily remained in the stock as a short momentum play. Given this type of inflection point for the underlying business combined with the current market environment leading HFs to crowd into shorts, a strong rally on GRPN fundamentals from here would likely lead to an acceleration of short covering, driving the stock closer to fair value in a relatively short amount of time.

Tldr: GRPN severely undervalued, has a ton of hidden value from investments, and is at a key inflection point exiting a restructuring at the same time that demand should flow back to the platform. Sentiment is still cautious enough to create a phenomenal entry point, while short interest is extremely high, creating a potential short squeeze as lazy momentum shorts unwind.

# Current Valuation &amp; Financials

Fwd P/S ’22: 0.67

Revenue Growth Est: 0% '22, 7% '23

* Revenue is expected to stabilize in 2022, though I suspect this is a great setup for continued upside surprises, boosted by the Things to Do and Beauty Goods verticals that are leveraged to easing covid restrictions.

Fwd P/E 10.9

EPS Growth Est: +41% '22

* EPS expected to inflect higher as cost restructuring gains take hold and revenue stabilizes &amp; accelerates as the world reopens post-covid and merchants return to the platform.

Fwd EV/EBITDA: 3.05

EBITDA Growth Est: 27% '22, 13% '23

* Strong EBITDA growth a direct result of cost restructuring and continued cost improvements. GRPN has used the pandemic crisis to shift strategies and drastically improve efficiency of operations and profitability.

Free Cash Flow Generation: +140% YoY '22

* FCF is expected to turn positive in '22 for the first time since 2019. GRPN currently trades at a 12% Fwd FCF Yield, very high for a growth stock inflecting to reaccelerate revenues. 4Q21 FCF is expected to grow at 290% YoY, with 1Q22 expected to be the first decisively positive FCF Q1 ever.

Equity Investments

* Equity investments are the 1000lb elephant in the room. The latest earnings report revalued LT investments at $123m on the balance sheet, though in Jan 2022, it was reported that SumUp (of which GRPN own's 2.4%) was preparing to raise an funding round at a $22bil valuation. If successful at this valuation, their equity position in Sumup would equate to approx 528m, increasing their investments by over 4x. In turn, their balance sheet equity would actually equate to a higher total value than their current market cap.

Analyst Price Target: $37, +67.6% upside

* Analysts have gone stale, with 60% of PTs updated prior to 2022. By leaving GRPN in the cold on updates to institutional investors, this has created opportunities once the company reports on Feb 28 for models to be revised higher and sell-side sentiment to suddenly become more optimistic given the current inflection point.
   * Barclays stated valuation is currently ""rock bottom"" and expects the marketing strategy to generate growth near term, though is waiting for confirmation of continued momentum before upgrading the stock from underweight. 
   * JPMorgan is also cautiously optimistic that the 2020-21 restructuring efforts are about to pay off through higher growth and a more profitable business.
* A recent report by Prescience Point Capital Mgmt established a longer-term fair value range of $69-100+ when accounting for the operating business and investments.

**TLDR2;** if you're too 'tarderd for the first one - two weeks ago the market Wile E. Coyote'd off a cliff, and in three weeks it's going to look down and hold up a sign that says ""oh no!""

I know, I know, I can hear you out there already, ""another stupid bear, stonks only go up, don't fight the FED"" etc etc.  So why should you listen to me?  How about because you know that 4% drop in SPY on 9/20 we had that fucked all of your portfolios sideways?  I fucking called that to the day [three months](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/og6ofy/housing_a_big_bubbly_pile_of_garbage_that_will/) ago.  Here's the relevant paragraph for those who can't be bothered to click on a link:  

&gt; My date range remains unchanged, sometime between June and November of this year. If you want some specific dates to watch, check July 12th, July 19th, August 23rd, September 20th, and October 25th. I probably like August 23rd the most of those, but I buy retard positions on WSB, so you definitely shouldn't listen to me. 

Let's review what happened on those dates:  July 12th, SPY went up 1%, July 19th, SPY dropped 3.4%, August 23rd, SPY went up .003%, September 20th, SPY dropped 4%.  Clearly I was wrong on July 12th, but that was also the date I had the weakest evidence for.  August 23rd for some reason was covered early the week before on the 18th and 19th.  So, you might be asking how did I know that we had market drops coming?  Well, it's pretty simple, I looked for dates when realized losses would hit.

Wait, what?  I predicted days the market would drop by looking for the days when people lost money?  Isn't that backwards?  Not really. Skip the next part if you don't care where the info comes from.  &gt;!See, one of the biggest and most asymmetric obstacles retail investors face in the market is information.  The big boys know when you're making your trades and front-run them with PFoF (payment for order flow - a practice where your broker sells your order information to a hedge fund, who uses computers and super high speed internet to sprint ahead of you in line, buy whatever you're going to buy, and then selling it to you at a higher price) giving you a worse price and skimming a tiny profit in the process.  The big boys know where your stop losses are at, they know where your buy limits are, and they will specifically dodge those or force hits on them depending on if their AI's tell them it's a good idea or not.!&lt;

&gt;!The best you can do for information on their positions is the 13F, which doesn't include a lot of the more popular types of trades anymore (everything swap related, any kind of bullshit insurance derivative, anything they entered AND left during the period between reporting dates, dark markets, some kinds of futures contracts, etc. etc.), and is at best 3 months out of date by the time you see it.  As a retail trader you have access to the following real-time data: futures contracts prices, stock prices, and the options chain.  The CFTC (commodities and futures trading commission) is doing everything it can to hide futures contracts prices, making them more opaque by the day, stock prices are so heavily manipulated by dark pool and naked short selling action that they're more lotto numbers than anything else.  (Don't believe me?  There's a video where an old guy with a phone and a pencil calls out price movements ahead of time hundreds of times in a row by looking at the level 2 data and cracking the code of how hedge fund and market maker algos use it to communicate with each other. No link because I just got off ban and the bots here can be touchy about links to YouTube.)  Oh, and after that video surfaced a couple people posted the actual rules those bots use to talk to each other, got forum slid off of every single reddit they appeared in within less than one day.!&lt;

&gt;!So what are we left with?  Mostly just the options chain, because it shows where the big boys think the prices are going, and if you cross it with the 13F data, you can sometimes find where a big player is exposed.  I will say the options chain is rapidly getting less reliable though.  Notice all the posts lately where they say ""get in now, the options chain is loaded for a gamma ramp!"" and then it doesn't happen?  Yeah, that's just a new spin on the old ""short squeeze"" pump and dump play.  The MM's and HF's sell the loaded chain naked, pump the stock above that point, chum up the waters to get retail to dive in, then naked short the fuck out of the stock to put it below the options, then do the slow bleed on price over the next few weeks to discourage people out of it, take a big position via dark pool, cover their shorts in the lit market to drive up the price, and repeat the whole damn process.  Stop falling for it folks. !&lt;

So, pinpointing when and how much these motherfuckers are going to lose gives us a good idea of how much they'll have to sell to cover their losses.  So, do we have any more known losses coming up?  Yes, yes we do.  And they are much, much, much fucking bigger.  The 7/19 and 9/20 losses were a couple of billion each.  But we're about to see a whole lot more than that on 10/20.  What happens on 10/20 you ask?  Well, that's 30 days from 9/20 - which is the first day that Evergrande missed paying the coupon on a USD denominated bond.  When a debt issuer misses a coupon payment, they've got 30 days to make it or the bond goes into default.  When bonds default, whatever secures them transfers over, in this case I believe it to be equity.  Well, guess what? Evergrande stock is fucking worthless.  So, a whole bunch of rich idiots are about to see an income generating security/collateral turn into junk stock, and realize losses.  This is going to fuck up their margin ratios, and make them sell a bunch of shit to get back in line.  T+2 from Oct 20 is Oct 22, which means Oct 25 suddenly looks pretty fuckin' spicy. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zpi2qlqn82r71.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5612457db3055bda0c5640006d8c11014e35bd43

The 9/20 coupon payment isn't the only one Evergrande has missed.  There's also the 9/23, and the 9/29 payments that have been missed.  Those hit 30 days on 10/23 and 10/27.  Maybe you saw some nonsense about EG paying making some debt payments lately?  Yeah, they paid the 9/23 coupon - for ONSHORE bonds, ie Yuan denominated debt, and they paid it ""partially in kind"" which means they handed over some parking spots and unfinished property that has negative value after you add up the costs to clear the half-finished buildings off of it.  They haven't paid shit on the money owed to foreigners, ie the $305B they owe in USD bonds.  These aren't the end of it either, there are additional coupon payments hitting basically every week until they've cycled through every single USD bond they have outstanding.

Now, if you're smarter than the average retard, you might start wondering at this point, who the biggest bagholders for that $305B in bad bonds is.  Well, let me tell you.  First, we've got the RBC (Royal Bank of Canada), which has $46B in EG bonds - and a market cap of $144B.  If you were wondering why there was that weird AH (after hours - the stock dropped 64% AH in one day, then ""fixed the glitch"" and went back up) mess with RBC about six months ago where it looked worthless and totally fucked for a minute?  Yeah, that was an actual view of the banks real financial state when these bonds hit zero.  This is also why Trudeau called elections early, because once this shitshow hits, nobody's getting re-elected.  This is also why if you check the Canadian TV broadcasts for NFL games a week ago, you'll find commercials stating that bank deposits are insured by the government.  They're prepping the public to try and avoid bank runs.  Here's a photo if you don't believe me:

&amp;#x200B;

[That's from a CDIC \(Canadian Deposit Insurance Company\) commercial that ran during last weeks NFL games](https://preview.redd.it/fx5tlaefc2r71.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=064cbea11f992a3da569345cf37de79c86d283d5)

On a sidenote, if this makes you nervous about the Fed's requirement that banks have $1 Trillion in high quality capital reserves on hand for a severe recession by 10/1, or BofA's massive issues with online banking and ATM's not working yesterday?  Well, it fucking should.

Next up we've got HSBC - the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited - I don't actually have a ton of info on them, but I've heard some bad rumors, and they probably fuk in general, but I don't have enough solid data to say anything with great certainty.  If you do, chime in in the comments  or DM me and I'll add it in here in an edit.

Finally, we've got Blackrock, the 4th branch of govt, with trillions of USD AUM (united states dollar assets under management).  They are very heavily exposed to Chinese junk debt from the real estate and property development sectors.  Their stock is down 10.5% on the month, which is more than SPY is over the same period, even counting from the ATH (all time high).

However, it's not just Evergrande that's a problem.  It's all the Chinese property development companies, and all of their foreign denominated debt. China recently started arresting executives from HNA - which is another huge developer, and SINIC stock has been suspended from trading for almost a month now after it fell 80%.  These are all big developers that are utterly fucked, EG is just the first domino to fall.  So, there is a lot more pain still to come.

I'd also like to take a second to dispel the myth that Xi - a hardline communist dictator - is going to bail out a bunch of western capitalists.  Because he's not.  Politicians work to their incentives.  Western politicians bail out banks and wall street because they keep power by making their rich donors happy.  Chinese politicians keep power by making the economy go up and maintaining domestic stability.  Neither of their goals is achieved by giving money to foreigners.  Also, they've got massive problems at home to worry about [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pyzpp1/the_2nd_largest_economy_on_earth_is_shitting_the/) post sums up just a few of the problems, but fails to address what's probably the biggest one, which is the 1.6 million apartments that Evergrande took money to build... but didn't.  And EG isn't the only one who pulled this.  The people, they are NOT happy about it.  They're already taking executives hostage, and protesting in public, both huge no-nos in China.  When they start grabbing bankers and low-ranking party officials... that's where the bad stuff really starts.

Ok, ok, maybe you're not a China boogeyman, maybe you don't like the idea of realized losses.  Maybe you're a big fan of charts, TA (technical analysis) and astrology for men.  Ok, then here's the six month SPX chart:

&amp;#x200B;

[See the nice shampoo commercial that's formed over the last two months on the YTD \(year to date\) SPX chart?  ](https://preview.redd.it/2tiyksdes2r71.png?width=1858&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=127b5677b00742c3d584e96372871b6fd1ec8368)

So, yeah, that's a clear head and shoulders that formed from August through the end of September.  On the SPX chart, at the end of a year and a half in which the market MORE THAN DOUBLED during a historic pandemic.  Surely the trend turning downwards won't be equally violent.  Surely.

So now let's move on from chart patterns to our good friend Elliot Waves.  Here's an example of a textbook Elliot Wave pattern, just so you know what we're talking about.

https://preview.redd.it/dtb5yhfoo2r71.jpg?width=259&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6866fe024ae207e0f5ef2db89c5e1fa4c0cc71e0

Now, let's look at an elliot wave chart of the market

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/09hpda2j03r71.gif

Oh whoops, my bad, that's not actually today's market, that's what things looked like in 2008 right before the crash.  Well, I'm sure today is different, right?

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vde6iw8s13r71.jpg?width=665&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f66c8a45452cb5688f593d3830d942b0d0de70b1

Ok, yeah, those are TOTALLY different pictures.  Right?  Right???  

Those are both taken from work by Robert Prather, who is really good at Elliot Waves, even if he is pretty dumb about other stuff.  And if you're wondering, yes this picture is pre-covid, so there's a final blip dip/spike missing, but it doesn't change that much of anything if they're there.  But if you need something truly wild that lights up your tinfoil and points to 2021, then I give you this masterpiece.

&amp;#x200B;

[Yeah, it really does work out with the years and everything.  Somebody call Nic Cage already.](https://preview.redd.it/3kjf206573r71.jpg?width=999&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc4c3978d2286339f2dcda430bea69b66e25d33b)

&amp;#x200B;

And one final chart of a particular stock that provides a large amount of idiosyncratic risk to the markets.

[Two weeks to wedge close and price breakout!](https://preview.redd.it/spxx4wyek3r71.jpg?width=2270&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8de41478d2382e4f939f4c28d8de1ebaf9006ac)

Taken from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/px5a35/months_long_trend_lines_on_gme_about_to_collide/) because u/originalspaceman1 drew it much better than I could.  Anyways, that 9 month wedge closes around October 14th or 15th.  Look, whether you agree or not with the whole GME Ape Saga, IF they're right, that is going to blow up the entire goddamn market.

Need more rainbow bear porn?  Ok, don't worry fam, I gotchu covered.  On this coming Monday, 10/4, Biden is unveiling his new China trade policy.  And from early leaks it looks strongly like he's going to take Trumps trade war, re-brand it, and make it smarter and less damaging to us.  

The eviction ban is over, and for some reason the expected mass wave of evictions hasn't happened yet - which means it's still coming.  A Census Bureau poll showed 3 million American households are very concerned about imminent eviction, the number of Americans behind on their rent varies from estimates of 6 million behind on rent from Moody's to 15 million behind on rent from the Aspen Institute.  Best guess?  Stuff is still working its way through the courts and there is lots of pain to come.  

The European energy crisis looks really, really bad early on, with people in Britain getting knifed in gas lines and the Army coming out to guard fuel transports.  Those are from headlines on CNN if you're wondering about the source.  

Inflation continues to run rampant.  Two of the local greasy spoons near my office have raised prices and come out with new menus in the last month, every trip to the grocery store I see something else is more expensive now, Germany - which is like, allergic to inflation on a genetic level - just posted a 4.1% increase YoY (Year over Year).

So, let's just sum everything up - 

* China is all kinds of fucked up
* Massive realized losses incoming that have to actually be accounted for
* Canadian TV reminding people that bank deposits are insured
* Head and Shoulders bearish pattern on the yearly SPX chart
* Elliot Waves say historic bomb incoming
* Tons more domestic pain from evictions still to arrive
* Energy crises in Europe and China
* Palantir - which is basically corporate SkyNet warns of a ""black swan event""
* GameStop finally going off or going away
* Historic record amounts of margin
* The CMBS loan market is full of shit and garbage like the MBS market in 2008

Ok, so what plays to make?  Well, basically, puts on everything and calls on anything inverse.  I think we have 2-3 market pumps left in the next three weeks before shit starts really going downhill.  One will be on whatever infrastructure deal passes, one will be on the debt ceiling getting resolved (Senate floor time on is actually a massive, and very unrecognized risk on that because nobody, including half of DC, can actually be bothered to understand how things work), and we might or might not get some kind of random ""miracle technology"" or whatever pump from the press.

All of those pumps WILL be used by the big boys to dump bags on to you, the retail investor.  Don't FOMO, don't buy the dip, take the rise in prices as a buying opportunity to go the other way.  These are my current positions, and I'm looking for market bumps to add more to them.

And, a very important quote from [my first](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oe9ruu/how_to_play_the_upcoming_market_crash/) DD on the crash which listed a June-November time range:

&gt;and remember, after September, comes October

Let's review what happened on those dates:  July 12th, SPY went up 1%, July 19th, SPY dropped 3.4%, August 23rd, SPY went up .003%, September 20th, SPY dropped 4%.  Clearly I was wrong on July 12th, but that was also the date I had the weakest evidence for.  August 23rd for some reason was covered early the week before on the 18th and 19th.  So, you might be asking how did I know that we had market drops coming?  Well, it's pretty simple, I looked for dates when realized losses would hit.

Wait, what?  I predicted days the market would drop by looking for the days when people lost money?  Isn't that backwards?  Not really. Skip the next part if you don't care where the info comes from.  &gt;!See, one of the biggest and most asymmetric obstacles retail investors face in the market is information.  The big boys know when you're making your trades and front-run them with PFoF (payment for order flow - a practice where your broker sells your order information to a hedge fund, who uses computers and super high speed internet to sprint ahead of you in line, buy whatever you're going to buy, and then selling it to you at a higher price) giving you a worse price and skimming a tiny profit in the process.  The big boys know where your stop losses are at, they know where your buy limits are, and they will specifically dodge those or force hits on them depending on if their AI's tell them it's a good idea or not.!&lt;

&gt;!The best you can do for information on their positions is the 13F, which doesn't include a lot of the more popular types of trades anymore (everything swap related, any kind of bullshit insurance derivative, anything they entered AND left during the period between reporting dates, dark markets, some kinds of futures contracts, etc. etc.), and is at best 3 months out of date by the time you see it.  As a retail trader you have access to the following real-time data: futures contracts prices, stock prices, and the options chain.  The CFTC (commodities and futures trading commission) is doing everything it can to hide futures contracts prices, making them more opaque by the day, stock prices are so heavily manipulated by dark pool and naked short selling action that they're more lotto numbers than anything else.  (Don't believe me?  There's a video where an old guy with a phone and a pencil calls out price movements ahead of time hundreds of times in a row by looking at the level 2 data and cracking the code of how hedge fund and market maker algos use it to communicate with each other. No link because I just got off ban and the bots here can be touchy about links to YouTube.)  Oh, and after that video surfaced a couple people posted the actual rules those bots use to talk to each other, got forum slid off of every single reddit they appeared in within less than one day.!&lt;

&gt;!So what are we left with?  Mostly just the options chain, because it shows where the big boys think the prices are going, and if you cross it with the 13F data, you can sometimes find where a big player is exposed.  I will say the options chain is rapidly getting less reliable though.  Notice all the posts lately where they say ""get in now, the options chain is loaded for a gamma ramp!"" and then it doesn't happen?  Yeah, that's just a new spin on the old ""short squeeze"" pump and dump play.  The MM's and HF's sell the loaded chain naked, pump the stock above that point, chum up the waters to get retail to dive in, then naked short the fuck out of the stock to put it below the options, then do the slow bleed on price over the next few weeks to discourage people out of it, take a big position via dark pool, cover their shorts in the lit market to drive up the price, and repeat the whole damn process.  Stop falling for it folks. !&lt;

So, pinpointing when and how much these motherfuckers are going to lose gives us a good idea of how much they'll have to sell to cover their losses.  So, do we have any more known losses coming up?  Yes, yes we do.  And they are much, much, much fucking bigger.  The 7/19 and 9/20 losses were a couple of billion each.  But we're about to see a whole lot more than that on 10/20.  What happens on 10/20 you ask?  Well, that's 30 days from 9/20 - which is the first day that Evergrande missed paying the coupon on a USD denominated bond.  When a debt issuer misses a coupon payment, they've got 30 days to make it or the bond goes into default.  When bonds default, whatever secures them transfers over, in this case I believe it to be equity.  Well, guess what? Evergrande stock is fucking worthless.  So, a whole bunch of rich idiots are about to see an income generating security/collateral turn into junk stock, and realize losses.  This is going to fuck up their margin ratios, and make them sell a bunch of shit to get back in line.  T+2 from Oct 20 is Oct 22, which means Oct 25 suddenly looks pretty fuckin' spicy. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zpi2qlqn82r71.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5612457db3055bda0c5640006d8c11014e35bd43

The 9/20 coupon payment isn't the only one Evergrande has missed.  There's also the 9/23, and the 9/29 payments that have been missed.  Those hit 30 days on 10/23 and 10/27.  Maybe you saw some nonsense about EG paying making some debt payments lately?  Yeah, they paid the 9/23 coupon - for ONSHORE bonds, ie Yuan denominated debt, and they paid it ""partially in kind"" which means they handed over some parking spots and unfinished property that has negative value after you add up the costs to clear the half-finished buildings off of it.  They haven't paid shit on the money owed to foreigners, ie the $305B they owe in USD bonds.  These aren't the end of it either, there are additional coupon payments hitting basically every week until they've cycled through every single USD bond they have outstanding.

Now, if you're smarter than the average retard, you might start wondering at this point, who the biggest bagholders for that $305B in bad bonds is.  Well, let me tell you.  First, we've got the RBC (Royal Bank of Canada), which has $46B in EG bonds - and a market cap of $144B.  If you were wondering why there was that weird AH (after hours - the stock dropped 64% AH in one day, then ""fixed the glitch"" and went back up) mess with RBC about six months ago where it looked worthless and totally fucked for a minute?  Yeah, that was an actual view of the banks real financial state when these bonds hit zero.  This is also why Trudeau called elections early, because once this shitshow hits, nobody's getting re-elected.  This is also why if you check the Canadian TV broadcasts for NFL games a week ago, you'll find commercials stating that bank deposits are insured by the government.  They're prepping the public to try and avoid bank runs.  Here's a photo if you don't believe me:

&amp;#x200B;

[That's from a CDIC \(Canadian Deposit Insurance Company\) commercial that ran during last weeks NFL games](https://preview.redd.it/fx5tlaefc2r71.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=064cbea11f992a3da569345cf37de79c86d283d5)

On a sidenote, if this makes you nervous about the Fed's requirement that banks have $1 Trillion in high quality capital reserves on hand for a severe recession by 10/1, or BofA's massive issues with online banking and ATM's not working yesterday?  Well, it fucking should.

Next up we've got HSBC - the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited - I don't actually have a ton of info on them, but I've heard some bad rumors, and they probably fuk in general, but I don't have enough solid data to say anything with great certainty.  If you do, chime in in the comments  or DM me and I'll add it in here in an edit.

Finally, we've got Blackrock, the 4th branch of govt, with trillions of USD AUM (united states dollar assets under management).  They are very heavily exposed to Chinese junk debt from the real estate and property development sectors.  Their stock is down 10.5% on the month, which is more than SPY is over the same period, even counting from the ATH (all time high).

However, it's not just Evergrande that's a problem.  It's all the Chinese property development companies, and all of their foreign denominated debt. China recently started arresting executives from HNA - which is another huge developer, and SINIC stock has been suspended from trading for almost a month now after it fell 80%.  These are all big developers that are utterly fucked, EG is just the first domino to fall.  So, there is a lot more pain still to come.

I'd also like to take a second to dispel the myth that Xi - a hardline communist dictator - is going to bail out a bunch of western capitalists.  Because he's not.  Politicians work to their incentives.  Western politicians bail out banks and wall street because they keep power by making their rich donors happy.  Chinese politicians keep power by making the economy go up and maintaining domestic stability.  Neither of their goals is achieved by giving money to foreigners.  Also, they've got massive problems at home to worry about [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pyzpp1/the_2nd_largest_economy_on_earth_is_shitting_the/) post sums up just a few of the problems, but fails to address what's probably the biggest one, which is the 1.6 million apartments that Evergrande took money to build... but didn't.  And EG isn't the only one who pulled this.  The people, they are NOT happy about it.  They're already taking executives hostage, and protesting in public, both huge no-nos in China.  When they start grabbing bankers and low-ranking party officials... that's where the bad stuff really starts.

Ok, ok, maybe you're not a China boogeyman, maybe you don't like the idea of realized losses.  Maybe you're a big fan of charts, TA (technical analysis) and astrology for men.  Ok, then here's the six month SPX chart:

&amp;#x200B;

[See the nice shampoo commercial that's formed over the last two months on the YTD \(year to date\) SPX chart?  ](https://preview.redd.it/2tiyksdes2r71.png?width=1858&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=127b5677b00742c3d584e96372871b6fd1ec8368)

So, yeah, that's a clear head and shoulders that formed from August through the end of September.  On the SPX chart, at the end of a year and a half in which the market MORE THAN DOUBLED during a historic pandemic.  Surely the trend turning downwards won't be equally violent.  Surely.

So now let's move on from chart patterns to our good friend Elliot Waves.  Here's an example of a textbook Elliot Wave pattern, just so you know what we're talking about.

https://preview.redd.it/dtb5yhfoo2r71.jpg?width=259&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6866fe024ae207e0f5ef2db89c5e1fa4c0cc71e0

Now, let's look at an elliot wave chart of the market

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/09hpda2j03r71.gif

Oh whoops, my bad, that's not actually today's market, that's what things looked like in 2008 right before the crash.  Well, I'm sure today is different, right?

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vde6iw8s13r71.jpg?width=665&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f66c8a45452cb5688f593d3830d942b0d0de70b1

Ok, yeah, those are TOTALLY different pictures.  Right?  Right???  

Those are both taken from work by Robert Prather, who is really good at Elliot Waves, even if he is pretty dumb about other stuff.  And if you're wondering, yes this picture is pre-covid, so there's a final blip dip/spike missing, but it doesn't change that much of anything if they're there.  But if you need something truly wild that lights up your tinfoil and points to 2021, then I give you this masterpiece.

&amp;#x200B;

[Yeah, it really does work out with the years and everything.  Somebody call Nic Cage already.](https://preview.redd.it/3kjf206573r71.jpg?width=999&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc4c3978d2286339f2dcda430bea69b66e25d33b)

&amp;#x200B;

And one final chart of a particular stock that provides a large amount of idiosyncratic risk to the markets.

[Two weeks to wedge close and price breakout!](https://preview.redd.it/spxx4wyek3r71.jpg?width=2270&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8de41478d2382e4f939f4c28d8de1ebaf9006ac)

Taken from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/px5a35/months_long_trend_lines_on_gme_about_to_collide/) because u/originalspaceman1 drew it much better than I could.  Anyways, that 9 month wedge closes around October 14th or 15th.  Look, whether you agree or not with the whole GME Ape Saga, IF they're right, that is going to blow up the entire goddamn market.

Need more rainbow bear porn?  Ok, don't worry fam, I gotchu covered.  On this coming Monday, 10/4, Biden is unveiling his new China trade policy.  And from early leaks it looks strongly like he's going to take Trumps trade war, re-brand it, and make it smarter and less damaging to us.  

The eviction ban is over, and for some reason the expected mass wave of evictions hasn't happened yet - which means it's still coming.  A Census Bureau poll showed 3 million American households are very concerned about imminent eviction, the number of Americans behind on their rent varies from estimates of 6 million behind on rent from Moody's to 15 million behind on rent from the Aspen Institute.  Best guess?  Stuff is still working its way through the courts and there is lots of pain to come.  

The European energy crisis looks really, really bad early on, with people in Britain getting knifed in gas lines and the Army coming out to guard fuel transports.  Those are from headlines on CNN if you're wondering about the source.  

Inflation continues to run rampant.  Two of the local greasy spoons near my office have raised prices and come out with new menus in the last month, every trip to the grocery store I see something else is more expensive now, Germany - which is like, allergic to inflation on a genetic level - just posted a 4.1% increase YoY (Year over Year).

So, let's just sum everything up - 

* China is all kinds of fucked up
* Massive realized losses incoming that have to actually be accounted for
* Canadian TV reminding people that bank deposits are insured
* Head and Shoulders bearish pattern on the yearly SPX chart
* Elliot Waves say historic bomb incoming
* Tons more domestic pain from evictions still to arrive
* Energy crises in Europe and China
* Palantir - which is basically corporate SkyNet warns of a ""black swan event""
* GameStop finally going off or going away
* Historic record amounts of margin
* The CMBS loan market is full of shit and garbage like the MBS market in 2008

Ok, so what plays to make?  Well, basically, puts on everything and calls on anything inverse.  I think we have 2-3 market pumps left in the next three weeks before shit starts really going downhill.  One will be on whatever infrastructure deal passes, one will be on the debt ceiling getting resolved (Senate floor time on is actually a massive, and very unrecognized risk on that because nobody, including half of DC, can actually be bothered to understand how things work), and we might or might not get some kind of random ""miracle technology"" or whatever pump from the press.

All of those pumps WILL be used by the big boys to dump bags on to you, the retail investor.  Don't FOMO, don't buy the dip, take the rise in prices as a buying opportunity to go the other way.  These are my current positions, and I'm looking for market bumps to add more to them.

There was a time GameStop was just among the masses of stocks. It wasted trending till it began to increase in volume and rise in share price.

None of these stocks even come to me as being a topic on this forum. We have seen *Longeveron* move upwards a bit. However, most of these stocks have either gone sideways, or have been getting ruined by shorting and bad earnings.

Unfortunately, hardly any articles that the author knows of, be they articles on ""professional"" websites or blogs, go into the **technology** **and** **product** **details** as well as **manufacturing costs** **for** **products** **of** the companies about whose shares a buy or sell recommendation is made. Nor on what this means for **future** sales, market and company prospects.

This is not surprising, many investors are no longer interested in companies and their products at all, only in (minimal) daily profits, especially the short sellers who ""argue"" with ""arguments"" like ""*what* *a* *scam*"", ""*what* *a* *sh.. ""* and the like ""argue"" without ever substantiating this classification. Main thing to create a (negative) mood to get others to sell. Same in the opposite direction. There is daily speculation about takeovers or attempts to bring about a short squeeze based on certain percentages that a stock is sold short.

Both are wrong in the first place.

Hardly any investors still invest in products and companies, many are only ""gamblers"". At the same time, these players put products, companies and jobs at risk. For example, a good product cannot be developed and sold overnight. Nevertheless, these gamblers expect results in days or weeks and months at the most, and if they don't come immediately, this is made out to be a problem. Even though everything within the company is on schedule. Even the development of an iPhone takes a year or more. More and more often you can read, especially with new products or companies, that the company has not made any sales or profits yet. How could it, if the product is still in development?

If that still doesn't work, the killer argument will eventually be used. Competitor XYZ is already on the market and sells more. Or already has many partners. This was also the argument regarding Apple when Nokia was still the world market leader for mobile phones and smartphones and Apple presented the first iPhone. The outcome is well known. Or with Tesla vis-à-vis the established car manufacturers. Today, a Tesla drives away even a Porsche and Tesla is constantly building new factories. Porsche, on the other hand, is also doing well, but cannot keep up with Tesla's expansion and is technically (e.g. in terms of range) lagging behind.

What all of this has in common is that you can't extrapolate from the past to the future. Otherwise, there would never be new market leaders. The future of a company lies in its current and future- oriented products, not in its old ones. There are, of course, exceptions to the rule, such as food manufacturers, like Coca-Cola, or banks, etc. Here, however, it should be about technical products and their manufacturers.

**Summary: Ultimately, only the business outlook determines the future of a company and thus the share price. The business outlook depends on the current and future products.**

That is why short sales figures etc. are not considered here. Instead,it will be shown **why there is currently only one company in the field of lidar sensors that meets all the requirements of large car manufacturers** such as Volkswagen, Toyota, etc. and where **a short squeeze could be triggered shortly due to their technical superiority**, since this technological superiority cannot be explained away or ""sold short"".

**It should likely cause price reactions when a company is valued at only about 1/3 the market cap of inferior competitors on the stock market, as** **Microvision** **currently is relative to** [**Luminar.**](https://www.luminartech.com/) Both companies in September 2021 at the world's largest motor show IAA in Munich:

Because in the field of lidar for self-driving cars (levels 3-5), the current ""official"" market leader is Luminar. ""Market leader"" mainly because of the market capitalization and the hype around the young company founder and CEO. Luminar has not sold any finished products yet. Last year, Luminar only sold about 100 development systems. I am not aware of numbers for 2021.

There is no car in the world that could be purchased with a Luminar lidar. This is already due to the fact that the company does not yet have a deliverable product.

However, if the market leader has not yet managed to launch and sell a product for **self-driving cars**, it is not surprising that its competitors have not yet been able to generate sales in this area either.

Is lidar necessary?

It should not be discussed further that Mr. Musk as CEO of the company Tesla [considered ](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/08/elon-musk-says-driverless-cars-dont-need-lidar-experts-arent-so-sure/)lidar systems [superfluous.](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/08/elon-musk-says-driverless-cars-dont-need-lidar-experts-arent-so-sure/) First of all, this statement is already more than two years old (from mid-2019) and was quite correct at that time. when lidar systems were far too expensive (up to $100,000), far too big so they had to be mounted on car roofs and their resolution was simply too poor compared to cameras. But development continues and today the situation is very different.

For [his part, ](https://www.pcworld.com/article/532605/worst_tech_predictions.html)an [IBM CEO had ](https://www.pcworld.com/article/532605/worst_tech_predictions.html)also [estimated the worldwide demand for computers at only about five](https://www.pcworld.com/article/532605/worst_tech_predictions.html) [(!) units.](https://www.pcworld.com/article/532605/worst_tech_predictions.html) This shows that even CEOs of global corporations can be wrong.

The [series of accidents with Tesla cars](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/08/elon-musk-says-driverless-cars-dont-need-lidar-experts-arent-so-sure/) show that cameras alone are probably not able to guarantee a safe control of a car.

In addition, there are **far larger car** **companies** **that** **see lidar** **as** **indispensable.**

Market for Lidar Systems

So, it should be undeniable that there is a market for lidar systems. With about 70 million cars produced per year plus trucks\*\*,\*\* etc., there will soon be an **annual** **demand of** **50-300 million units** (usually several modules are needed per car, just as a Tesla has many cameras; at least one device each for the view to the front and one for the view to the rear), even if you exclude the Tesla cars.

Technology

After the introduction to the topic, we will now look at the technology and **why** **it** **cannot** **be that** a **technologically** **highly superior** **company is** **only valued at a company value of** **only** **1/3** **of** **the** **technically** **far** **inferior** **""market** **leader""** and thus a **short** **squeeze** **should only be a matter** **of** **time,** since the true valuation very probably cannot be prevented for a long time.

This should occur at the latest when the first orders come in or when just enough investors realize that **something** **seems** **to** **be** **fundamentally wrong here**. Depending on what happens first. Both can happen on a daily basis.

Upcoming orders can be considered almost certain due to the superior technology and the much earlier availability of the Microvision models.

Car manufacturers are not interested in TV appearances by CEOs or fairytale up-and-coming stories; they want to build the best cars in their segment and for their target group.

General requirements of car manufacturers for car models

All car manufacturers in all target groups have the following essential requirements:

* Security
* Design
* Vehicle characteristics (such as maximum speed, turning circle, etc.)
* Price

Depending on the target group of a car model, these are of course weighted differently, so that no order can be given. Only safety should always be at the top of the list for all manufacturers.

Of course, a Mercedes has to look better or different than a pick-up. But it doesn't have to be as maneuverable and its load area can be smaller. However, it is no longer possible to sell ugly pick-ups today. While roof superstructures may not bother pick-ups, they are probably not acceptable for a Mercedes, Volkswagen or Toyota.

In terms of lidar systems, this means:

* Security:  

   * Highest possible resolution
   * Refresh rate must be high enough for short response times
   * non-dazzle
* Design: as invisible as possible
* Price: must match the selling price of the vehicle

System comparison

So, let's compare the (only) system from the (previous) market leader Luminar with those from Microvision (four models in total).

First of all, it is noticeable that Luminar intends to sell only one model with the product ""Iris"", while Microvision intends to offer three other models in addition to the top model and to cover other market segments with lower or specialized requirements.

Luminar Iris and Microvision Lidar models:

Security: Resolution

This is quite simple to understand. As is also known for cameras, a camera or a lidar system sees more details and thus smaller objects, the higher the resolution. **If** **the resolution** **is lower** **than that** **of** **the competition,** **a** **lidar** **system** **is** **generally considered to be less** **reliable,** as it may detect a tree, but not a stone on the road. However, both can be dangerous.

**Only the resolutions measured by the companies themselves and officially published shall be considered.**

The company Luminar has **measured a resolution of** **600,000** **points** **per** **second for** their model ""Hydra"":

&gt;*Measurement* *Rate* *per Pixel* *600,000* *pt/s*

The future **successor** **model** intended for sale is **to have a** **50%** **increase** **in** **resolution,** **i.e.** **approximately 900,000** **dots** **per** **second**. The 50% increase is due to the fact that the resolution in dots per square degree is to increase from 200 to 300 and the other parameters are to remain essentially unchanged:

In contrast, Microvision **measured a** **resolution of** **over** **10** **million points** **per** **second**. That is **twelve** **times** the **resolution** **that** **Luminar** **offers**. This means that a Microvision Lidar system can also **detect** **twelve times** **more details**.

Accordingly, Microvision also writes on its website of

**These details have been there for months and were not changed after the world's largest auto show, the IAA in Munich in September 2021, where all the big-name rivals were also exhibiting.**

**Nor** **does** **any other** **competitor** **appear** **to** **claim** **the ""highest** **resolution"".** As far as we know, no Microvision competitor has complained to the SEC about misrepresentation, so even the **competition,** **including** **Luminar,** **seems** **to accept** **that** **Microvision Lidar** **has the highest** **resolution** **for** **lidar** **systems** **for** **self-driving cars**.

The differences in resolution were particularly visible at the IAA in Munich this September. Both Luminar and Microvision filmed the visitors on or in front of their booths. The environmental conditions were therefore almost identical.

Luminar Iris Resolution:

Source: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsrp3QQ-Abg)

It is clearly visible that Luminar only shows single lines, while Microvision shows closed objects. No wonder with a twelvefold higher resolution.

**This makes the score 1-0 in favor of Microvision over Luminar.**

This in the already most important category, because as already mentioned, the **resolution** **is** **the** **most** **important** **to** recognize as **many** **details** **as** **possible**, i.e. objects on and beside the road, which could be a danger for the car or others (e.g. small children or animals should not be run over).

Safety: refresh rate

The frame rate (Hz) is also very important. It indicates how many images a camera or lidar system delivers per second.

For example, if only one image per second is created, a car at a speed of 100 km/h has already covered a distance of 27.78 meters in that time. This corresponds to the length of about six cars. At a frame rate of 30, on the other hand, the car has covered less than one meter per frame. Thus, at 30 Hz, a passenger car has 30 times more decision-making power and (time) to react to something and can do so 30 times faster.

Luminar and Microvision lidar systems each have up to 30 Hz.

On closer inspection, however, it is noticeable that Microvision systems always seem to have 30 Hz, Luminar Lidar lies in the range of 1-30 Hz. **This** **suggests** **that** **with higher** **frame** **rates** **at** **Luminar** **Iris** **the resolution decreases** while it remains the same at Microvision, so there are 30 images with the high resolution.

📷

Source: Luminar Iris data sheet and [Microvision](https://www.microvision.com/) October 2021

Microvision thus seems to be significantly better here as well. However, since the details are not known what exactly 1-30 Hz means for Luminar, this category is not evaluated conclusively.

Safety: non-blinding

Everyone knows it: If you look into the sun without sunglasses, you will be blinded and see less or almost nothing. The same applies to cameras, but also lidar systems. Here, glare protection is necessary. For people, sunglasses. With cameras and especially lidar systems it is technically much more complex.

For lidar systems there is even not only one sun, but several. **If** **there are** **several cars on a road** **within sight** **of a lidar** **system,** **which also have lidar** **systems,** **these** **lidar** **systems can dazzle each** **other**. This will almost always occur in the future if many cars are equipped with lidar systems.

**In discussions about lidar companies, this problem gets little attention as far as I know.**

**This** **is** **one of** **the main problems** **that** **lidar** **companies** **have to** **solve.** **Without a** **complete** **solution,** **a lidar system** **can hardly** **be used in** **a meaningful way,** **since it** **can be blinded and consequently** **temporarily** **be** **completely or** **partially** **blind - while** **the** **car continues** **to drive.**

This is because **lidar** **systems** **themselves** **emit** **light** **in the form** **of** **laser** **pulses** and wait to see whether it is reflected. If it is reflected, it will eventually return to the lidar system. The distance of the reflected object can then be determined from the duration, since the speed of light is both known and constant.

**Lidar systems thus illuminate the environment in areas of light that are invisible to humans.**

Consequence: **A** **lidar system** **may be dazzled from** **all** **sides,** **as if many laser** **pointers were directed** **at** **the lidar** **system**. So not only the own light comes back, but also foreign light.

A lidar system must therefore ignore all extraneous light and filter out its own on the amount of light. It must not measure extraneous light under any circumstances.

**This is a technically highly complex and difficult problem to solve.**

**As** **far** **as** **the author** **knows,** **only Microvision has** **solved this** **problem completely**.

The company Luminar has recognized the problem after all and names it also officially, has however according to own representation on the Internet side no complete solution for it. But only a partial solution whereby this is not defined more precisely:

&gt;*limited* *interference*

However, Microvision clearly states that the lidar systems **are** **completely** **immune** **to light** **from** **other** **lidar systems** **and the sun** as show below from the [Microvision](https://www.microvision.com/) October 2021.

According to Microvision, it has adopted a solution that Microvision has already developed for the HoloLens 2 from Microsoft and which is also used there. This is probably also patented.

**A** **lidar** **system** **like Luminar's, which is** **only** **partially immune to other lidar systems** **and sunlight,** **is** **simply too dangerous** and can be blinded or even provide false information, endangering lives.

This point goes clearly to Microvision. **The** **score** **is** **therefore** **2:0**.

Other competitors also don't seem to have solved this hugely important problem yet. Innoviz has only considered sunlight even with InnovizTwo. Also Blickfeld has not solved the problem, but only for sunlight. This seems to apply to all competitors This would make Microvision the only company whose lidar systems are completely immune to light from other lidar systems. For comparison:

Practicability

The author still knows the Walkman from Sony. For the younger ones: These were cassette recorders that could play music that was recorded on magnetic tapes. This tape had to be moved and that was done by a belt drive. The belt drive (and not a direct drive) was used to soften vibrations. This technology from the 80s of the last century is used by Luminar as a drive in Luminar Iris as shown in a patent drawing below (top picture is the inside of a Sony Walkman):

📷

Source: [Walkman](https://blog.fh-kaernten.at/ingmarsretro/tag/walkman-en/?lang=en) and Luminar patent drawing.

The reason is simple: Luminar, like Sony back then, also wants to avoid vibrations being transmitted to the shaft.

However, the author doubts that the Luminar Lidar system Iris will survive everyday car use for years without repairs. Belts wear out, become brittle and even the slightest changes in length etc. will render the systems unusable and result in high repair costs for the car owner.

The other moving parts such as shafts will also wear out. The slightest changes will also render the system unusable, since a laser beam has to be controlled, which requires the highest precision. With Sony Walkman, the music didn't sound as good then. With Luminar, the system will fail immediately. After all,cars have a lifespan of ten to twenty years.

Almost all of Luminar's competitors do not have this problem. Since they, including Microvision, do not use any moving parts in their systems, at least in the new models. **Microvision has** **chosen the** **right** **architecture** **with** **Solid State,** **which has long** **proven its** **suitability for** **everyday** **use** **in the** **Microsoft** **HoloLens 2** **and** **the further** **development** **IVAS** **for** **the US** **Army,** even under the most difficult conditions that regularly occur in the military.

DesignHowever, a safe car is of no use if no one buys it.

Since design is very important in all areas of life, from smartphones to cars, and is at least one of the deciding factors in a purchase decision, if not the deciding factor, no car manufacturer can afford to install ugly lidar systems, such as those used to be installed on the roof or as attachments in the front, etc.

While Microvision plans to install its lidar system where the interior rearview mirror is located, Luminar wants to install the Iris model on the roof in a bulge in the roof.

Installation suggestion from Microvision:

**This is where the mechanical-optical internal design of Luminar Iris takes its toll, resulting in a lidar system that is many times larger than Microvision's chip-based lidar system, which has no mechanical parts.**

The dimensions of Luminar Iris are according to the official Luminar data sheet:

Source: Luminar Iris data sheet

📷

Thus, Luminar Iris without holders has a volume of: 27 cm \* 5,4 cm \* 10,6 cm = 1\*\*.545,48 ccm\*\*

The A-sample from Microvision has a size of approx.

20 cm \* 11 cm \* 3,4 cm = 748 ccm

**It should be noted that** **the** **data from** **Luminar** **are** **the final** **dimensions,** **while** **Microvision has** **only** **measured a prototype**, the size of which could be **halved in** the final product to **about 350 ccm**, as Microvision told visitors at the IAA.

The Microvision Lidar has therefore already as prototype only half the volume and like Luminar Iris and final, optimized product probably less than 1/5 of the size of Luminar Iris.

Very important for car manufacturers to know: While **Luminar** **Iris is** **wide and tall**, the **Microvision** **Lidar** **system** **is** **narrow** **and** **flat**.

Only this design allows the seamless integration into car designs.

From this author's point of view, the **size and shape of** **Microvision's lidar system** is **a knockout** **criterion for** **all car** **manufacturers who don't** **want to** **disfigure their** **car** **design**.

In addition, self-driving cars **require at** **least** **two** **lidar** **systems**, one for the view to the front and one for the view to the rear. The roof would therefore have to be bulged out at the front and rear to accommodate the Luminar lidar systems.

Microvision lidar is both very thin and very narrow, while Luminar lidar is relatively thick and very wide. Car designers needed thin and narrow lidar systems.

**This** **point** **also goes** **clearly to Microvision,** **so the** **score** **is** **already 3:0.**

PriceDevelopment costs

By its nature, **a price of a** **component** **strongly** **depends** **on the number** **of** **pieces**. This is because a price is made up of several components. They are the fixed costs, the cost of materials and manufacturing costs (and service, recycling costs etc.)

The fixed costs are, for example, the costs of development but also the other general costs that a company has and that are attributable to the product. They become lower per unit the higher the number of units. Development costs of 1 million dollars mean that products sold in quantity 1 must cost at least 1 million dollars. However, if the product is sold in a million units, the price of a unit is only at least $1.

Development costs incurred:

* Luminar: All expenses in the last ten years, as the company has only developed one product so far: **Accumulated deficit: $697,254,000** (Source: [Luminar Q2 2021 Results](https://www.luminartech.com/luminar-reports-q2-2021-results-and-business-update/))
* Microvision: Operating costs for approximately two years, as development did not begin until early 2020 and company previously developed and sold other products (such as a projector for Sony, Sharp, Ragenthek; interactive projector, consumer lidar, projectors for HoloLens 2). Here, we can assume roughly **$50 million**, as Microvision's operating costs are about $25 million per year (Source: [Q2 2021](https://ir.microvision.com/news-events/ir-calendar/detail/9856/q2-2021-financial-and-operating-results-call)).

**This makes the development costs to be allocated to the final prices about $800 million for Luminar by the start of production in late 2022 and only about $50 million for Microvision.**

**This** **means** **that** **the development** **costs** **for** **Luminar's** **lidar** **systems** **are approximately 16** **times** **those for** **Microvision**. Of course, this has to be taken into account in the pricing.

Production costs

However, the development costs do not yet constitute a product. The material costs in particular must be taken into account here. As a rule of thumb: The more expensive a material is and the more material is needed, the more expensive a product will be. A watch made of gold is more expensive than one made of steel. In the same way, a car is more expensive than a bicycle because it requires much more material (and for other reasons).

Both the amount of material needed and the manufacturing costs should be much lower for Microvision. While the Luminar Lidar consists of solid aluminum blocks, Microvision probably only needs a plastic housing.

In addition, Luminar has many mechanical components, whereas Microvision uses a chip-sized MEMS module and does not use any mechanical components and therefore does not have to manufacture any mechanical components:

📷

Sources: Luminar patent application and [Microvision](https://ir.microvision.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/333/microvision-announces-completion-of-its-long-range-lidar)

It is interesting that Luminar never shows the internal structure of Iris. Luminar always shows only empty cases.

Microvision, on the other hand, can use inexpensive plastic because Microvision does not use moving parts.

The mechanical components in the Luminar Lidar are not likely to be cheap to produce either, but they are much cheaper than the production of the many mechanical components, as **Luminar** **requires** **many machines** **such as** **lathes** **and milling machines** **for** **this,** **on** **which they** **have to be** **turned and milled to extremely low** **tolerances,** **for** **example**.

Sources: Luminar [Q1 Update](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_KGdSMOZdc&amp;feature=emb_logo) and [Q2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxmSsHsaDKc)

Please watch these videos, how complex the production of the Luminar Lidar is, while Microvision (see photo above) only has to assemble printed circuit boards, connect them and insert them into a housing. These differences are the reason why Luminar Lidar- System will never be able to produce as cheap as Microvision:

* [The Path to Series Production: Q1 Update - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_KGdSMOZdc&amp;feature=emb_logo)
* [The Path to Series Production: Q2 Update - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxmSsHsaDKc&amp;t=118s)

That's also why it takes Luminar two years just to set up production, while Microvision has developed a completely new system and can produce it in that time. Above is also Luminar's schedule (from [The Path to Series Production: Q1 Update - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_KGdSMOZdc&amp;feature=emb_logo)).

Costs increase in manufacturing the lower the tolerances have to be. The lower the tolerances that have to be maintained during production, the more expensive they are. The **costs** **do not** **increase linearly,** **but** **rather** **exponentially**.

It goes without saying that only very low tolerances can be permitted here for the control of a laser beam, which certainly go to the limits of what is feasible.

This means that the **manufacturing costs** are certainly **many** **times** **higher** **than those of** **Microvision** due

* to the high-precision machines
* very precise tools required
* **Luminar** **lidar** **consists** **of** **many more individual** **parts** **and**
* significantly higher costs for quality assurance and testing.

**Luminar ends up doing what Microvision does on a chip basis (MEMS), controlling a laser beam, the old-fashioned way via mechanical components like shafts and a belt drive. See patent drawing before.**

The result is not only a much larger device, much poorer resolution due to the limitations of the Luminar concept (e.g. moving masses, inertia, etc.) but also much higher cost to manufacture simply due to the large number of components.

**Luminar** **thus** **undoubtedly** **needs** **significantly more** **material,** **more machinery** **and more personnel** **to produce a lidar** **system,** since **more** **steps** **are** **required** due to the large number of mechanical parts **and** **a high degree of** **automation does** **not** **seem** **possible**.

The Microvision Lidar can be assembled on almost any (automated) assembly line for smartphones or computers, since it consists of nothing more than a housing, computer chips and circuit boards, just like any smartphone, notebook or computer.

**It** **can therefore be assumed that** **Luminar** **Iris** **is** **significantly more expensive to** **manufacture than** **Microvision Lidar.**

Scalability

Since Microvision apparently does not have **any moving** **mechanical parts** to finish and therefore **does** **not** need any **special machines,** but will be able to use virtually any production line for smartphones or computers, there are not **only the correspondingly** **high** **costs** **for** **their** **own** **factories** **as** **Luminar** **needs** **them** and is also currently creating, but the **scalability and thus** **the** **deliverability is** **significantly** **higher**.

Smartphones are now manufactured in quantities of hundreds of millions per year. Computers in similar orders of magnitude. **Consequently,** **it** **should** **not** **be difficult for Microvision to produce** **almost** **any number** **of** **units** **required if a** **mass** **producer** **such as** **Foxconn** **is** **commissioned**.

Development status

While Luminar is still testing the stopping in front of a dummy on a short test section at low speed according to the last published videos, Microvision has already a company specialized in such tests with its own employees to test on a company-owned test track at high speeds. The following presentation of Luminar shows the current progress:

Customers and partners

A distinction must be made between customers (= companies that actually buy larger quantities of the products) and partners (= companies with whom contacts exist, e.g. for development, testing, etc., but who do not buy much or anything).

Customers

Luminar does not have any known customers who purchase larger quantities for their end products. In fact, Luminar has not published any order intake to date.

For Microvision, the same is true for its Lidar division. In the other business areas, however, Microvision has already achieved sales in the double-digit million-dollar range, almost exclusively with Tier 1 companies, such as Sony, Sharp, Microsoft:

📷

Source: [Microvision](https://www.microvision.com/) October 2021 and [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/buy)

Unlike Luminar, Microvision is recognized as a supplier by market-leading companies and has already demonstrated the ability to deliver products of the required quality in high volume that are e.g. in use by the US Army through the Microsoft IVAS.

Partners

This refers to companies that have some kind of agreement for something.

Luminar lists many partners who do pay for development systems and services.

Microvision is run by techies who shun publicity. Luminar, on the other hand, is led by a ""sunny boy"" and startup CEO [Austin Russell](https://nypost.com/2020/12/04/luminar-chief-austin-russell-25-is-billionaire-after-ipo/).

Microvision has been in contact with Tier 1 automakers for years ([Q2 2021](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_1384295b36c7ce41a69ebebc0424ca35/microvision/db/1111/9864/file/MVIS%2BQ2%2B2021%2BAugust%2B4%2C2021%2BWebcast%2BTranscript%281%29.pdf)):

Tier 1 car manufacturers in Germany are (only):

* Volkswagen with the group brands VW, Audi, Porsche, etc.
* Mercedes
* BMW

**This** **suggests** **which companies** **Microvision** **might** **be** **negotiating** **with at** **the** **moment**.

Confidence of the CEO in his own company

[The Luminar CEO is currently selling $200 million of his own stock](https://investors.luminartech.com/node/7546/html) \- before the first product is even sold.

**This** **shows** **the** **CEO's** **dwindling confidence** **in his** **own** **company**.

Leadership

Not to forget the excellent CEO Microvision has, who has done an **extremely** **good** **job** in a very short time (two years) and has the qualifications to lead Microvision to the world market leader in lidar systems and smart glasses. This is where his experience and qualification pays off which the Luminar CEO does not have.

**His** **personal** **commitment** **and enthusiasm for** **success** **should also** **be** **emphasized**. While the Luminar CEO only appeared at the IAA in Munich for photo opportunities, the Microvision CEO was on site every day to meet with customers.

Potential gains in lidar division for Microvision

Approximately 70 million passenger cars are produced worldwide every year. In addition, there are trucks, etc.

As stated, 2-4 lidar systems are needed for cars, which **would** **correspond to** an **annual** **number** **of** **about** **150-300** **million units**.

**If Microvision could achieve just 10% share, thus selling 15-30 million units per year, that would equate to $750 million to $1.5 billion in annual profits at just $50 earnings per unit.**

**At a very conservative P/E of 10, the market cap would then have to be $7.5 billion to $15 billion. That would equate to a share price of about $50-$100.**

Microvision is thus undervalued not only relative to Luminar, but also relative to the expected gutters in the next few years. The author also assumes that Microvision will achieve a significantly higher market share than only 10%.

**The current Luminar stock price of about $15 is equivalent to a Microvision stock price of $30, since Luminar has issued almost exactly twice as many shares as Microvision.**

Precise forecasts (volumen, profit margin) are difficult. However, it can be assumed that - as with airbags - **lidar systems will soon be installed in almost all cars by few suppliers.** The market will likely consolidate quickly - because of Microvision's technical superiority with Microvision at the top.

Conclusion

Conclusion remains: **Luminar** **has** **no future** **as** **a** **lidar** **manufacturer** **due to** **its** **already** **fundamentally** **outdated and non-performing** **hardware base**. At least not with large car manufacturers. Luminar could only specialize in software.

**Microvision, on the other hand, has the best chance in the market for lidar systems for self-driving cars because of its technically superior hardware base that has been proven in mass-market products such as the Microsoft HoloLens 2.**

Microvision is also very much at an advantage, as mass production will start as early as this year, while Luminar is not scheduled to start until late 2022.

In addition, the **excellent,** **efficient** **and highly** **qualified management** **and development** **team** is certainly **superior** **to** **Luminar**. It has developed the Microvision Lidar from scratch to production readiness in only two years, while the Luminar team needs two years longer.

**Therefore, it is only a matter of (probably short time) that Microvision receives the first orders from large automotive companies like Volkswagen, Mercedes, BMW etc. This makes short selling of shares very risky.**

**Orders can come** **in daily.** **Also, at** **some point** **stock** **buyers** **may recognize** **the massive undervaluation of** **Microvision** **stock** **in** **comparison to Luminar** **and at** **the same time initiate a short** **squeeze,** **which could** **lead to** **a price of** **$60 per** Microvision share. **$30 per Microvision share currently corresponds to the market capitalization of Luminar**.

What has also gone completely **unnoticed** in the discussion is that **Microvision Lidar** **is** **probably the** **only** **system** **in the world that is fully immune to light** **from** **other** **lidar** **systems**.

**Other manufacturers specify this only for sunlight as discussed before.**

**However, this is one of the most important features for lidar systems to meet. Microvision also proved this as the only company at the IAA by having two lidar systems facing each other.**

Many cars constantly encounter each other at the same time, on roads, in parking lots, etc. When they dazzle each other, accidents are inevitable. That's why Microvision is probably the only company, which shows this in a video. **The others** **just** **can't** **do it as far as known.**

**This** **technological** **breakthrough**\*\*,\*\* **which has** **so far** **been completely** **disregarded in the** **valuation of** **the stock,** **is** **a** **very big** **competitive advantage** \- along with the others such as resolution, form factor, etc.

That's why here is the link to the Microvision video again. **This** **technology** **alone** **could make an** **advantage of** **billions** **of** **dollars** **in profits** **and make Microvision the** **market** **leader**:

📷Other business areas

Not included in this analysis are the other business areas. While Luminar has no other businesses, Microvision is the market leader in AR glasses, at least for projectors (see Microsoft HoloLens 2), and also offers [solutions ](https://www.microvision.com/solutions/other-solutions/)for HUD, interactive projectors, consumer lidar. **The solution for** **smart** **glasses** **can have a similar** **success as** **the one for** **lidar** **systems.**

Unfortunately, hardly any articles that the author knows of, be they articles on ""professional"" websites or blogs, go into the **technology** **and** **product** **details** as well as **manufacturing costs** **for** **products** **of** the companies about whose shares a buy or sell recommendation is made. Nor on what this means for **future** sales, market and company prospects.

This is not surprising, many investors are no longer interested in companies and their products at all, only in (minimal) daily profits, especially the short sellers who ""argue"" with ""arguments"" like ""*what* *a* *scam*"", ""*what* *a* *sh.. ""* and the like ""argue"" without ever substantiating this classification. Main thing to create a (negative) mood to get others to sell. Same in the opposite direction. There is daily speculation about takeovers or attempts to bring about a short squeeze based on certain percentages that a stock is sold short.

Both are wrong in the first place.

Hardly any investors still invest in products and companies, many are only ""gamblers"". At the same time, these players put products, companies and jobs at risk. For example, a good product cannot be developed and sold overnight. Nevertheless, these gamblers expect results in days or weeks and months at the most, and if they don't come immediately, this is made out to be a problem. Even though everything within the company is on schedule. Even the development of an iPhone takes a year or more. More and more often you can read, especially with new products or companies, that the company has not made any sales or profits yet. How could it, if the product is still in development?

If that still doesn't work, the killer argument will eventually be used. Competitor XYZ is already on the market and sells more. Or already has many partners. This was also the argument regarding Apple when Nokia was still the world market leader for mobile phones and smartphones and Apple presented the first iPhone. The outcome is well known. Or with Tesla vis-à-vis the established car manufacturers. Today, a Tesla drives away even a Porsche and Tesla is constantly building new factories. Porsche, on the other hand, is also doing well, but cannot keep up with Tesla's expansion and is technically (e.g. in terms of range) lagging behind.

What all of this has in common is that you can't extrapolate from the past to the future. Otherwise, there would never be new market leaders. The future of a company lies in its current and future- oriented products, not in its old ones. There are, of course, exceptions to the rule, such as food manufacturers, like Coca-Cola, or banks, etc. Here, however, it should be about technical products and their manufacturers.

**Summary: Ultimately, only the business outlook determines the future of a company and thus the share price. The business outlook depends on the current and future products.**

That is why short sales figures etc. are not considered here. Instead,it will be shown **why there is currently only one company in the field of lidar sensors that meets all the requirements of large car manufacturers** such as Volkswagen, Toyota, etc. and where **a short squeeze could be triggered shortly due to their technical superiority**, since this technological superiority cannot be explained away or ""sold short"".

**It should likely cause price reactions when a company is valued at only about 1/3 the market cap of inferior competitors on the stock market, as** **Microvision** **currently is relative to** [**Luminar.**](https://www.luminartech.com/) Both companies in September 2021 at the world's largest motor show IAA in Munich:

Because in the field of lidar for self-driving cars (levels 3-5), the current ""official"" market leader is Luminar. ""Market leader"" mainly because of the market capitalization and the hype around the young company founder and CEO. Luminar has not sold any finished products yet. Last year, Luminar only sold about 100 development systems. I am not aware of numbers for 2021.

There is no car in the world that could be purchased with a Luminar lidar. This is already due to the fact that the company does not yet have a deliverable product.

However, if the market leader has not yet managed to launch and sell a product for **self-driving cars**, it is not surprising that its competitors have not yet been able to generate sales in this area either.

Is lidar necessary?

It should not be discussed further that Mr. Musk as CEO of the company Tesla [considered ](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/08/elon-musk-says-driverless-cars-dont-need-lidar-experts-arent-so-sure/)lidar systems [superfluous.](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/08/elon-musk-says-driverless-cars-dont-need-lidar-experts-arent-so-sure/) First of all, this statement is already more than two years old (from mid-2019) and was quite correct at that time. when lidar systems were far too expensive (up to $100,000), far too big so they had to be mounted on car roofs and their resolution was simply too poor compared to cameras. But development continues and today the situation is very different.

For [his part, ](https://www.pcworld.com/article/532605/worst_tech_predictions.html)an [IBM CEO had ](https://www.pcworld.com/article/532605/worst_tech_predictions.html)also [estimated the worldwide demand for computers at only about five](https://www.pcworld.com/article/532605/worst_tech_predictions.html) [(!) units.](https://www.pcworld.com/article/532605/worst_tech_predictions.html) This shows that even CEOs of global corporations can be wrong.

The [series of accidents with Tesla cars](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/08/elon-musk-says-driverless-cars-dont-need-lidar-experts-arent-so-sure/) show that cameras alone are probably not able to guarantee a safe control of a car.

In addition, there are **far larger car** **companies** **that** **see lidar** **as** **indispensable.**

Market for Lidar Systems

So, it should be undeniable that there is a market for lidar systems. With about 70 million cars produced per year plus trucks\*\*,\*\* etc., there will soon be an **annual** **demand of** **50-300 million units** (usually several modules are needed per car, just as a Tesla has many cameras; at least one device each for the view to the front and one for the view to the rear), even if you exclude the Tesla cars.

Technology

After the introduction to the topic, we will now look at the technology and **why** **it** **cannot** **be that** a **technologically** **highly superior** **company is** **only valued at a company value of** **only** **1/3** **of** **the** **technically** **far** **inferior** **""market** **leader""** and thus a **short** **squeeze** **should only be a matter** **of** **time,** since the true valuation very probably cannot be prevented for a long time.

This should occur at the latest when the first orders come in or when just enough investors realize that **something** **seems** **to** **be** **fundamentally wrong here**. Depending on what happens first. Both can happen on a daily basis.

Upcoming orders can be considered almost certain due to the superior technology and the much earlier availability of the Microvision models.

Car manufacturers are not interested in TV appearances by CEOs or fairytale up-and-coming stories; they want to build the best cars in their segment and for their target group.

General requirements of car manufacturers for car models

All car manufacturers in all target groups have the following essential requirements:

* Security
* Design
* Vehicle characteristics (such as maximum speed, turning circle, etc.)
* Price

Depending on the target group of a car model, these are of course weighted differently, so that no order can be given. Only safety should always be at the top of the list for all manufacturers.

Of course, a Mercedes has to look better or different than a pick-up. But it doesn't have to be as maneuverable and its load area can be smaller. However, it is no longer possible to sell ugly pick-ups today. While roof superstructures may not bother pick-ups, they are probably not acceptable for a Mercedes, Volkswagen or Toyota.

In terms of lidar systems, this means:

* Security:  

   * Highest possible resolution
   * Refresh rate must be high enough for short response times
   * non-dazzle
* Design: as invisible as possible
* Price: must match the selling price of the vehicle

System comparison

So, let's compare the (only) system from the (previous) market leader Luminar with those from Microvision (four models in total).

First of all, it is noticeable that Luminar intends to sell only one model with the product ""Iris"", while Microvision intends to offer three other models in addition to the top model and to cover other market segments with lower or specialized requirements.

Luminar Iris and Microvision Lidar models:

Security: Resolution

This is quite simple to understand. As is also known for cameras, a camera or a lidar system sees more details and thus smaller objects, the higher the resolution. **If** **the resolution** **is lower** **than that** **of** **the competition,** **a** **lidar** **system** **is** **generally considered to be less** **reliable,** as it may detect a tree, but not a stone on the road. However, both can be dangerous.

**Only the resolutions measured by the companies themselves and officially published shall be considered.**

The company Luminar has **measured a resolution of** **600,000** **points** **per** **second for** their model ""Hydra"":

&gt;*Measurement* *Rate* *per Pixel* *600,000* *pt/s*

The future **successor** **model** intended for sale is **to have a** **50%** **increase** **in** **resolution,** **i.e.** **approximately 900,000** **dots** **per** **second**. The 50% increase is due to the fact that the resolution in dots per square degree is to increase from 200 to 300 and the other parameters are to remain essentially unchanged:

In contrast, Microvision **measured a** **resolution of** **over** **10** **million points** **per** **second**. That is **twelve** **times** the **resolution** **that** **Luminar** **offers**. This means that a Microvision Lidar system can also **detect** **twelve times** **more details**.

Accordingly, Microvision also writes on its website of

&gt;*The industry's highest resolution, full velocity, long-range automotive lidar sensor.*

**These details have been there for months and were not changed after the world's largest auto show, the IAA in Munich in September 2021, where all the big-name rivals were also exhibiting.**

**Nor** **does** **any other** **competitor** **appear** **to** **claim** **the ""highest** **resolution"".** As far as we know, no Microvision competitor has complained to the SEC about misrepresentation, so even the **competition,** **including** **Luminar,** **seems** **to accept** **that** **Microvision Lidar** **has the highest** **resolution** **for** **lidar** **systems** **for** **self-driving cars**.

The differences in resolution were particularly visible at the IAA in Munich this September. Both Luminar and Microvision filmed the visitors on or in front of their booths. The environmental conditions were therefore almost identical.

Luminar Iris Resolution:

Source: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsrp3QQ-Abg)

It is clearly visible that Luminar only shows single lines, while Microvision shows closed objects. No wonder with a twelvefold higher resolution.

**This makes the score 1-0 in favor of Microvision over Luminar.**

This in the already most important category, because as already mentioned, the **resolution** **is** **the** **most** **important** **to** recognize as **many** **details** **as** **possible**, i.e. objects on and beside the road, which could be a danger for the car or others (e.g. small children or animals should not be run over).

Safety: refresh rate

The frame rate (Hz) is also very important. It indicates how many images a camera or lidar system delivers per second.

For example, if only one image per second is created, a car at a speed of 100 km/h has already covered a distance of 27.78 meters in that time. This corresponds to the length of about six cars. At a frame rate of 30, on the other hand, the car has covered less than one meter per frame. Thus, at 30 Hz, a passenger car has 30 times more decision-making power and (time) to react to something and can do so 30 times faster.

Luminar and Microvision lidar systems each have up to 30 Hz.

On closer inspection, however, it is noticeable that Microvision systems always seem to have 30 Hz, Luminar Lidar lies in the range of 1-30 Hz. **This** **suggests** **that** **with higher** **frame** **rates** **at** **Luminar** **Iris** **the resolution decreases** while it remains the same at Microvision, so there are 30 images with the high resolution.

📷

Source: Luminar Iris data sheet and [Microvision](https://www.microvision.com/) October 2021

Microvision thus seems to be significantly better here as well. However, since the details are not known what exactly 1-30 Hz means for Luminar, this category is not evaluated conclusively.

Safety: non-blinding

Everyone knows it: If you look into the sun without sunglasses, you will be blinded and see less or almost nothing. The same applies to cameras, but also lidar systems. Here, glare protection is necessary. For people, sunglasses. With cameras and especially lidar systems it is technically much more complex.

For lidar systems there is even not only one sun, but several. **If** **there are** **several cars on a road** **within sight** **of a lidar** **system,** **which also have lidar** **systems,** **these** **lidar** **systems can dazzle each** **other**. This will almost always occur in the future if many cars are equipped with lidar systems.

**In discussions about lidar companies, this problem gets little attention as far as I know.**

**This** **is** **one of** **the main problems** **that** **lidar** **companies** **have to** **solve.** **Without a** **complete** **solution,** **a lidar system** **can hardly** **be used in** **a meaningful way,** **since it** **can be blinded and consequently** **temporarily** **be** **completely or** **partially** **blind - while** **the** **car continues** **to drive.**

This is because **lidar** **systems** **themselves** **emit** **light** **in the form** **of** **laser** **pulses** and wait to see whether it is reflected. If it is reflected, it will eventually return to the lidar system. The distance of the reflected object can then be determined from the duration, since the speed of light is both known and constant.

**Lidar systems thus illuminate the environment in areas of light that are invisible to humans.**

Consequence: **A** **lidar system** **may be dazzled from** **all** **sides,** **as if many laser** **pointers were directed** **at** **the lidar** **system**. So not only the own light comes back, but also foreign light.

A lidar system must therefore ignore all extraneous light and filter out its own on the amount of light. It must not measure extraneous light under any circumstances.

**This is a technically highly complex and difficult problem to solve.**

**As** **far** **as** **the author** **knows,** **only Microvision has** **solved this** **problem completely**.

The company Luminar has recognized the problem after all and names it also officially, has however according to own representation on the Internet side no complete solution for it. But only a partial solution whereby this is not defined more precisely:

&gt;*limited* *interference*

However, Microvision clearly states that the lidar systems **are** **completely** **immune** **to light** **from** **other** **lidar systems** **and the sun** as show below from the [Microvision](https://www.microvision.com/) October 2021.

Video content from the [youtube video ""Interference Immunity"":](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK3t8zFcl3I) Microvision's description to the video states complete immunity to other lidar systems (""free""):

According to Microvision, it has adopted a solution that Microvision has already developed for the HoloLens 2 from Microsoft and which is also used there. This is probably also patented.

**A** **lidar** **system** **like Luminar's, which is** **only** **partially immune to other lidar systems** **and sunlight,** **is** **simply too dangerous** and can be blinded or even provide false information, endangering lives.

This point goes clearly to Microvision. **The** **score** **is** **therefore** **2:0**.

Other competitors also don't seem to have solved this hugely important problem yet. Innoviz has only considered sunlight even with InnovizTwo. Also Blickfeld has not solved the problem, but only for sunlight. This seems to apply to all competitors This would make Microvision the only company whose lidar systems are completely immune to light from other lidar systems. For comparison:

Practicability

The author still knows the Walkman from Sony. For the younger ones: These were cassette recorders that could play music that was recorded on magnetic tapes. This tape had to be moved and that was done by a belt drive. The belt drive (and not a direct drive) was used to soften vibrations. This technology from the 80s of the last century is used by Luminar as a drive in Luminar Iris as shown in a patent drawing below (top picture is the inside of a Sony Walkman):

📷

Source: [Walkman](https://blog.fh-kaernten.at/ingmarsretro/tag/walkman-en/?lang=en) and Luminar patent drawing.

The reason is simple: Luminar, like Sony back then, also wants to avoid vibrations being transmitted to the shaft.

However, the author doubts that the Luminar Lidar system Iris will survive everyday car use for years without repairs. Belts wear out, become brittle and even the slightest changes in length etc. will render the systems unusable and result in high repair costs for the car owner.

The other moving parts such as shafts will also wear out. The slightest changes will also render the system unusable, since a laser beam has to be controlled, which requires the highest precision. With Sony Walkman, the music didn't sound as good then. With Luminar, the system will fail immediately. After all,cars have a lifespan of ten to twenty years.

Almost all of Luminar's competitors do not have this problem. Since they, including Microvision, do not use any moving parts in their systems, at least in the new models. **Microvision has** **chosen the** **right** **architecture** **with** **Solid State,** **which has long** **proven its** **suitability for** **everyday** **use** **in the** **Microsoft** **HoloLens 2** **and** **the further** **development** **IVAS** **for** **the US** **Army,** even under the most difficult conditions that regularly occur in the military.

DesignHowever, a safe car is of no use if no one buys it.

Since design is very important in all areas of life, from smartphones to cars, and is at least one of the deciding factors in a purchase decision, if not the deciding factor, no car manufacturer can afford to install ugly lidar systems, such as those used to be installed on the roof or as attachments in the front, etc.

While Microvision plans to install its lidar system where the interior rearview mirror is located, Luminar wants to install the Iris model on the roof in a bulge in the roof.

**This is where the mechanical-optical internal design of Luminar Iris takes its toll, resulting in a lidar system that is many times larger than Microvision's chip-based lidar system, which has no mechanical parts.**

The dimensions of Luminar Iris are according to the official Luminar data sheet:

Source: Luminar Iris data sheet

📷

Thus, Luminar Iris without holders has a volume of: 27 cm \* 5,4 cm \* 10,6 cm = 1\*\*.545,48 ccm\*\*

The A-sample from Microvision has a size of approx.

20 cm \* 11 cm \* 3,4 cm = 748 ccm

**It should be noted that** **the** **data from** **Luminar** **are** **the final** **dimensions,** **while** **Microvision has** **only** **measured a prototype**, the size of which could be **halved in** the final product to **about 350 ccm**, as Microvision told visitors at the IAA.

The Microvision Lidar has therefore already as prototype only half the volume and like Luminar Iris and final, optimized product probably less than 1/5 of the size of Luminar Iris.

Very important for car manufacturers to know: While **Luminar** **Iris is** **wide and tall**, the **Microvision** **Lidar** **system** **is** **narrow** **and** **flat**.

Only this design allows the seamless integration into car designs.

From this author's point of view, the **size and shape of** **Microvision's lidar system** is **a knockout** **criterion for** **all car** **manufacturers who don't** **want to** **disfigure their** **car** **design**.

In addition, self-driving cars **require at** **least** **two** **lidar** **systems**, one for the view to the front and one for the view to the rear. The roof would therefore have to be bulged out at the front and rear to accommodate the Luminar lidar systems.

Microvision lidar is both very thin and very narrow, while Luminar lidar is relatively thick and very wide. Car designers needed thin and narrow lidar systems.

**This** **point** **also goes** **clearly to Microvision,** **so the** **score** **is** **already 3:0.**

PriceDevelopment costs

By its nature, **a price of a** **component** **strongly** **depends** **on the number** **of** **pieces**. This is because a price is made up of several components. They are the fixed costs, the cost of materials and manufacturing costs (and service, recycling costs etc.)

The fixed costs are, for example, the costs of development but also the other general costs that a company has and that are attributable to the product. They become lower per unit the higher the number of units. Development costs of 1 million dollars mean that products sold in quantity 1 must cost at least 1 million dollars. However, if the product is sold in a million units, the price of a unit is only at least $1.

Development costs incurred:

* Luminar: All expenses in the last ten years, as the company has only developed one product so far: **Accumulated deficit: $697,254,000** (Source: [Luminar Q2 2021 Results](https://www.luminartech.com/luminar-reports-q2-2021-results-and-business-update/))
* Microvision: Operating costs for approximately two years, as development did not begin until early 2020 and company previously developed and sold other products (such as a projector for Sony, Sharp, Ragenthek; interactive projector, consumer lidar, projectors for HoloLens 2). Here, we can assume roughly **$50 million**, as Microvision's operating costs are about $25 million per year (Source: [Q2 2021](https://ir.microvision.com/news-events/ir-calendar/detail/9856/q2-2021-financial-and-operating-results-call)).

**This makes the development costs to be allocated to the final prices about $800 million for Luminar by the start of production in late 2022 and only about $50 million for Microvision.**

**This** **means** **that** **the development** **costs** **for** **Luminar's** **lidar** **systems** **are approximately 16** **times** **those for** **Microvision**. Of course, this has to be taken into account in the pricing.

Production costs

However, the development costs do not yet constitute a product. The material costs in particular must be taken into account here. As a rule of thumb: The more expensive a material is and the more material is needed, the more expensive a product will be. A watch made of gold is more expensive than one made of steel. In the same way, a car is more expensive than a bicycle because it requires much more material (and for other reasons).

Both the amount of material needed and the manufacturing costs should be much lower for Microvision. While the Luminar Lidar consists of solid aluminum blocks, Microvision probably only needs a plastic housing.

In addition, Luminar has many mechanical components, whereas Microvision uses a chip-sized MEMS module and does not use any mechanical components and therefore does not have to manufacture any mechanical components:

It is interesting that Luminar never shows the internal structure of Iris. Luminar always shows only empty cases.

Microvision, on the other hand, can use inexpensive plastic because Microvision does not use moving parts.

The mechanical components in the Luminar Lidar are not likely to be cheap to produce either, but they are much cheaper than the production of the many mechanical components, as **Luminar** **requires** **many machines** **such as** **lathes** **and milling machines** **for** **this,** **on** **which they** **have to be** **turned and milled to extremely low** **tolerances,** **for** **example**.

Please watch these videos, how complex the production of the Luminar Lidar is, while Microvision (see photo above) only has to assemble printed circuit boards, connect them and insert them into a housing. These differences are the reason why Luminar Lidar- System will never be able to produce as cheap as Microvision:

* [The Path to Series Production: Q1 Update - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_KGdSMOZdc&amp;feature=emb_logo)
* [The Path to Series Production: Q2 Update - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxmSsHsaDKc&amp;t=118s)

That's also why it takes Luminar two years just to set up production, while Microvision has developed a completely new system and can produce it in that time. Above is also Luminar's schedule (from [The Path to Series Production: Q1 Update - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_KGdSMOZdc&amp;feature=emb_logo)).

Costs increase in manufacturing the lower the tolerances have to be. The lower the tolerances that have to be maintained during production, the more expensive they are. The **costs** **do not** **increase linearly,** **but** **rather** **exponentially**.

It goes without saying that only very low tolerances can be permitted here for the control of a laser beam, which certainly go to the limits of what is feasible.

This means that the **manufacturing costs** are certainly **many** **times** **higher** **than those of** **Microvision** due

* to the high-precision machines
* very precise tools required
* **Luminar** **lidar** **consists** **of** **many more individual** **parts** **and**
* significantly higher costs for quality assurance and testing.

**Luminar ends up doing what Microvision does on a chip basis (MEMS), controlling a laser beam, the old-fashioned way via mechanical components like shafts and a belt drive. See patent drawing before.**

The result is not only a much larger device, much poorer resolution due to the limitations of the Luminar concept (e.g. moving masses, inertia, etc.) but also much higher cost to manufacture simply due to the large number of components.

**Luminar** **thus** **undoubtedly** **needs** **significantly more** **material,** **more machinery** **and more personnel** **to produce a lidar** **system,** since **more** **steps** **are** **required** due to the large number of mechanical parts **and** **a high degree of** **automation does** **not** **seem** **possible**.

The Microvision Lidar can be assembled on almost any (automated) assembly line for smartphones or computers, since it consists of nothing more than a housing, computer chips and circuit boards, just like any smartphone, notebook or computer.

**It** **can therefore be assumed that** **Luminar** **Iris** **is** **significantly more expensive to** **manufacture than** **Microvision Lidar.**

Scalability

Since Microvision apparently does not have **any moving** **mechanical parts** to finish and therefore **does** **not** need any **special machines,** but will be able to use virtually any production line for smartphones or computers, there are not **only the correspondingly** **high** **costs** **for** **their** **own** **factories** **as** **Luminar** **needs** **them** and is also currently creating, but the **scalability and thus** **the** **deliverability is** **significantly** **higher**.

Smartphones are now manufactured in quantities of hundreds of millions per year. Computers in similar orders of magnitude. **Consequently,** **it** **should** **not** **be difficult for Microvision to produce** **almost** **any number** **of** **units** **required if a** **mass** **producer** **such as** **Foxconn** **is** **commissioned**.

Development status

While Luminar is still testing the stopping in front of a dummy on a short test section at low speed according to the last published videos, Microvision has already a company specialized in such tests with its own employees to test on a company-owned test track at high speeds. The following presentation of Luminar shows the current progress:

Customers and partners

A distinction must be made between customers (= companies that actually buy larger quantities of the products) and partners (= companies with whom contacts exist, e.g. for development, testing, etc., but who do not buy much or anything).

Customers

Luminar does not have any known customers who purchase larger quantities for their end products. In fact, Luminar has not published any order intake to date.

For Microvision, the same is true for its Lidar division. In the other business areas, however, Microvision has already achieved sales in the double-digit million-dollar range, almost exclusively with Tier 1 companies, such as Sony, Sharp, Microsoft:

Source: [Microvision](https://www.microvision.com/) October 2021 and [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/buy)

Unlike Luminar, Microvision is recognized as a supplier by market-leading companies and has already demonstrated the ability to deliver products of the required quality in high volume that are e.g. in use by the US Army through the Microsoft IVAS.

Partners

This refers to companies that have some kind of agreement for something.

Luminar lists many partners who do pay for development systems and services.

Microvision is run by techies who shun publicity. Luminar, on the other hand, is led by a ""sunny boy"" and startup CEO [Austin Russell](https://nypost.com/2020/12/04/luminar-chief-austin-russell-25-is-billionaire-after-ipo/).

Microvision has been in contact with Tier 1 automakers for years ([Q2 2021](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_1384295b36c7ce41a69ebebc0424ca35/microvision/db/1111/9864/file/MVIS%2BQ2%2B2021%2BAugust%2B4%2C2021%2BWebcast%2BTranscript%281%29.pdf)):

Tier 1 car manufacturers in Germany are (only):

* Volkswagen with the group brands VW, Audi, Porsche, etc.
* Mercedes
* BMW

**This** **suggests** **which companies** **Microvision** **might** **be** **negotiating** **with at** **the** **moment**.

Confidence of the CEO in his own company

[The Luminar CEO is currently selling $200 million of his own stock](https://investors.luminartech.com/node/7546/html) \- before the first product is even sold.

**This** **shows** **the** **CEO's** **dwindling confidence** **in his** **own** **company**.

Leadership

Not to forget the excellent CEO Microvision has, who has done an **extremely** **good** **job** in a very short time (two years) and has the qualifications to lead Microvision to the world market leader in lidar systems and smart glasses. This is where his experience and qualification pays off which the Luminar CEO does not have.

**His** **personal** **commitment** **and enthusiasm for** **success** **should also** **be** **emphasized**. While the Luminar CEO only appeared at the IAA in Munich for photo opportunities, the Microvision CEO was on site every day to meet with customers.

Potential gains in lidar division for Microvision

Approximately 70 million passenger cars are produced worldwide every year. In addition, there are trucks, etc.

As stated, 2-4 lidar systems are needed for cars, which **would** **correspond to** an **annual** **number** **of** **about** **150-300** **million units**.

**If Microvision could achieve just 10% share, thus selling 15-30 million units per year, that would equate to $750 million to $1.5 billion in annual profits at just $50 earnings per unit.**

**At a very conservative P/E of 10, the market cap would then have to be $7.5 billion to $15 billion. That would equate to a share price of about $50-$100.**

Microvision is thus undervalued not only relative to Luminar, but also relative to the expected gutters in the next few years. The author also assumes that Microvision will achieve a significantly higher market share than only 10%.

**The current Luminar stock price of about $15 is equivalent to a Microvision stock price of $30, since Luminar has issued almost exactly twice as many shares as Microvision.**

Precise forecasts (volumen, profit margin) are difficult. However, it can be assumed that - as with airbags - **lidar systems will soon be installed in almost all cars by few suppliers.** The market will likely consolidate quickly - because of Microvision's technical superiority with Microvision at the top.

Conclusion

Conclusion remains: **Luminar** **has** **no future** **as** **a** **lidar** **manufacturer** **due to** **its** **already** **fundamentally** **outdated and non-performing** **hardware base**. At least not with large car manufacturers. Luminar could only specialize in software.

**Microvision, on the other hand, has the best chance in the market for lidar systems for self-driving cars because of its technically superior hardware base that has been proven in mass-market products such as the Microsoft HoloLens 2.**

Microvision is also very much at an advantage, as mass production will start as early as this year, while Luminar is not scheduled to start until late 2022.

In addition, the **excellent,** **efficient** **and highly** **qualified management** **and development** **team** is certainly **superior** **to** **Luminar**. It has developed the Microvision Lidar from scratch to production readiness in only two years, while the Luminar team needs two years longer.

**Therefore, it is only a matter of (probably short time) that Microvision receives the first orders from large automotive companies like Volkswagen, Mercedes, BMW etc. This makes short selling of shares very risky.**

**Orders can come** **in daily.** **Also, at** **some point** **stock** **buyers** **may recognize** **the massive undervaluation of** **Microvision** **stock** **in** **comparison to Luminar** **and at** **the same time initiate a short** **squeeze,** **which could** **lead to** **a price of** **$60 per** Microvision share. **$30 per Microvision share currently corresponds to the market capitalization of Luminar**.

What has also gone completely **unnoticed** in the discussion is that **Microvision Lidar** **is** **probably the** **only** **system** **in the world that is fully immune to light** **from** **other** **lidar** **systems**.

**Other manufacturers specify this only for sunlight as discussed before.**

**However, this is one of the most important features for lidar systems to meet. Microvision also proved this as the only company at the IAA by having two lidar systems facing each other.**

Many cars constantly encounter each other at the same time, on roads, in parking lots, etc. When they dazzle each other, accidents are inevitable. That's why Microvision is probably the only company, which shows this in a video. **The others** **just** **can't** **do it as far as known.**

**This** **technological** **breakthrough**\*\*,\*\* **which has** **so far** **been completely** **disregarded in the** **valuation of** **the stock,** **is** **a** **very big** **competitive advantage** \- along with the others such as resolution, form factor, etc.

That's why here is the link to the Microvision video again. **This** **technology** **alone** **could make an** **advantage of** **billions** **of** **dollars** **in profits** **and make Microvision the** **market** **leader**:

Not included in this analysis are the other business areas. While Luminar has no other businesses, Microvision is the market leader in AR glasses, at least for projectors (see Microsoft HoloLens 2), and also offers [solutions ](https://www.microvision.com/solutions/other-solutions/)for HUD, interactive projectors, consumer lidar. **The solution for** **smart** **glasses** **can have a similar** **success as** **the one for** **lidar** **systems.**

    FUBO has a low market cap of around 3B today.  I expect it to do more revenue it 2023 than that low 3B alone, and growth will continue to be high and drive it much further in the future. 
     After being in a relatively steady zone, FUBO stock  looked poised to break out just before earnings, but sold off and fell 40% after a tremendous earnings report.   We know short interest has remained high at around 20% of the float, and the stock price has certainly fluctuated in this manner before.  However, this is the a rare chance to pick up a stock that will eventually 10-15X in a short period of time.  
     For starters, their growth rate is insane.  The number of customer acquisitions are growing so fast estimates have risen 4 times this year.  They now have about 1.1 million customers.  To put that in perspective, they had roughly 300,000 users going into Q3 of last year.  That’s over a 300% growth looking at that short time period.  This high growth rate resulted in revenue growing 156% YoY. Keep in mind that there are still almost 80 million households with traditional cable.  It is estimated that 50 million of them will cut of cable for an alternate TV package in the next five years.  Over the last 18 months, FUBO has increased its market share In acquiring these customers faster than any competitor, including Sling and YouTubeTV.  Conservatively, FUBO will get 20% of these 50 million customers as they are already hitting that marker.  This would be a growth of over 1000% from Oct 2021 to 2026  But that 20% is low in my opinion, and they will most likely continue to increase their pie in this category, and could easily get 33% of future cord cutters. This alone would add around 15 million net users in the next 5 years.  Another thing that separates FUBO from traditional cable is availability.  With traditional cable, you have to live in an area with a cable service, and some people that live in rural or undeveloped  areas will not have access to a Comcast or Verizon choice but would be able to get FUBO.  As FUBO continues to become a recognized name, it will take market share from satellite companies that have a worse service.  Additionally, FUBO is a superior service to people who move or travel a lot, as they always immediately have access to the full service and can watch FUBO on any streaming device without needing Cable Boxes, a satellite, or being at their installed location to get a TV service like Cox or Comcast.  This would add to more customers not in the cable cutter area, and at a minimum, expect another 1 million subscribers here.

Not only are the customers growing for FUBO, but the QUALITY of one user is much more meaningful for FUBO than when compared to Netflix, Disney, DraftKings, etc.  The average revenue per user for stand alone streaming services is small, normally between $10-14.  For FUBO, it was $69 last quarter, or about 500% higher and is growing at a higher rate than that of its peers.  The number of hours people watch FUBO is higher than any streaming service that exists, giving it the opportunity to generate more advertising revenue than its competitors.  The reason it’s higher is because it focuses on live sports, which captures the users attention for a few hours at a time rather than traditional television shows.   

FUBO is getting into creating their own content centered around sports analysis and discussion. I expect that as their sports betting service takes off, more original content will be developed for this as well.  With sports betting, FUBO has one huge advantage that hasn’t really been discussed.  Sports betting has an extremely high customer acquisition cost, which is why you see all of the advertising of TV and everywhere else.  DG estimated it to be around $800.  For FUBO, their customer acquisition costs is much closer to $0 than $800, as the customers they are attracting are already paying subscribers.  
The technology FUBO uses for its service is light years ahead of its peers.  For those who haven’t seen it’s ability to connect with your smart phone, it’s a  really feature and allows your phone to be more engaged with your TV than just acting like a remote as it can give live betting options and stats and syncs with your TV to change as you change the game.  Another nice feature is Fanview, which gives the user to see sports stats while they are watching the game. They also offer several games for free in 4K quality, something it’s competitors do not.  These great sports features will help it capture sports betting market share.  I expect it to capture a portion of the sports betting frenzy, which will add revenue to its bottom line in the hundreds of millions.

People discuss the high short interest, which is about the same as AMC but this stock doesn’t need a short squeeze to get the price up.  The short squeeze potential is here and real, but not needed to be a good investment.  It will be successful either way, although the shorts need to burn here as well as they have been playing with fire on this one for far too long.

Additionally, FUBO is a superior service to people who move or travel a lot, as they always immediately have access to the full service and can watch FUBO on any streaming device without needing Cable Boxes, a satellite, or being at their installed location to get a TV service like Cox or Comcast.  This would add to more customers not in the cable cutter area, and at a minimum, expect another 1 million subscribers here.

Not only are the customers growing for FUBO, but the QUALITY of one user is much more meaningful for FUBO than when compared to Netflix, Disney, DraftKings, etc.  The average revenue per user for stand alone streaming services is small, normally between $10-14.  For FUBO, it was $69 last quarter, or about 500% higher and is growing at a higher rate than that of its peers.  The number of hours people watch FUBO is higher than any streaming service that exists, giving it the opportunity to generate more advertising revenue than its competitors.  The reason it’s higher is because it focuses on live sports, which captures the users attention for a few hours at a time rather than traditional television shows.   

FUBO is getting into creating their own content centered around sports analysis and discussion. I expect that as their sports betting service takes off, more original content will be developed for this as well.  With sports betting, FUBO has one huge advantage that hasn’t really been discussed.  Sports betting has an extremely high customer acquisition cost, which is why you see all of the advertising of TV and everywhere else.  DG estimated it to be around $800.  For FUBO, their customer acquisition costs is much closer to $0 than $800, as the customers they are attracting are already paying subscribers.  
The technology FUBO uses for its service is light years ahead of its peers.  For those who haven’t seen it’s ability to connect with your smart phone, it’s a  really feature and allows your phone to be more engaged with your TV than just acting like a remote as it can give live betting options and stats and syncs with your TV to change as you change the game.  Another nice feature is Fanview, which gives the user to see sports stats while they are watching the game. They also offer several games for free in 4K quality, something it’s competitors do not.  These great sports features will help it capture sports betting market share.  I expect it to capture a portion of the sports betting frenzy, which will add revenue to its bottom line in the hundreds of millions.

Again, full credit to YieldFanatic and YieldFanatic.com as I’m too retarded to do a DD like this one. But to be fair I tried to tell you retards about HIMAX a while back. YieldFanatic’s DD is more on the spectrum than mine though;


(Images missing)
7th November 2021
Welcome to the Yield Fanatic’s Trade Idea series. This write up is on the Taiwanese
semiconductor business, Himax. The shares are listed on NASDAQ and the ticker is $HIMX.
The date of write up is 7th November 2021 – as I write this, $HIMX’s current share price is $11.45 and market cap is roughly $2.0 billion. Note that this isn’t part of the deep dive series like I mostly present but rather a unique tactical trade idea given where this company trades at the moment.
But as always, before we start, the disclaimer. A few points worth noting:
Firstly, this is not investment advice nor is it a recommendation to buy or sell any security. This is just the Yield Fanatic’s opinion of the stock in question. If you wish to seek advice, please do so from an accredited financial advisor, which the Yield Fanatic is not.
Secondly, the opinion shown in this presentation is based on Yield’s read of things. Your view may be different based on your read of things, but it is the difference in views and opinion that makes a market.
The aim of this write up and recording is to give you an unbiased VIEW of the opportunity in question. The aim is to give you all the data that you need to make your own decision.
And finally, the Yield Fanatic does have a position in Himax at present and so, the opinions expressed here may be biased. This is a name that I have traded in the past and which I will continually trade in and out of.
To be clear, the Yield Fanatic does reserve to trade or invest in the name, subject to views and valuation at that specific point in time.
   Finally and before we start, note that this was originally written up for the purpose of posting on Reddit, so the tone may seem different to the one normally adopted on my other pieces of work.
 $HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present. TLDR:
 1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company – trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!
 The shares are cheap in a more “normal” S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as stupid cheap with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation
 2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.
3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4’21 and even Q1’22, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have consistently delivered

 results “to guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether.
 4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year – representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.
 5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.
  ..and now for the fun bit:
 6. Potential for a significant short squeeze. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were ~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to ~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.
 The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short – and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “GME X’mas special”.
7. Cant confirm this (unconfirmed hearsay) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up..... and it has already shot up ~15% last couple of weeks.
  Disclosure: I own stock + Jan’22 and Mar’22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan’22 and $10 Mar’22).
 
 What does $HIMX do? Products?
 Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here’s a quick snippet of what Himax does:
$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make ‘panels’ which are, in turn, used in:
 - Large sized DDICs -&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc
 - Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs -&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc
   In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:
- High end Timing Controller which improves power efficiency in displays
   - WiseEye ultra power AI --&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ AI and ML to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet
 of Things (IoT) area.
 
  - Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays – with usage in AR/VR glasses, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), Holographic Displays, etc.
 
- Other products in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)
  As a summary – the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:
 
Revenue by segment:
Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) – with Automotive OEM representing ~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs ~12.5%.
  However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.
The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.
  
 Competitors and Market Shares:
In the Q3’21 presentation (available here), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).
You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.
As for market share by the individual segments, as of Q3’21, $HIMX’s market shares were:
   - Large DDIC: 10.5%
  - Smartphones: 10.4%
 - Tablets: 37.7% but note that $HIMX has &gt; 60% market share of Android / non iOS tablets – the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.
   - Automotive OEM: 32.8%
  So, what has been happening recently with Himax?
2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.
Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products.
 
 $HIMX management foresaw that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes”, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.
When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially.... and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.
Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX
 found itself in a very sweet spot.
This gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked. When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players), $HIMX walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!
This allowed it to take a decent amount of market share over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.
So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?
$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) .....but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like Internet of Things (IoT) and Automotive/vehicles.
In addition, the modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV) would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.
   
 On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such 5G and high performance computing (HPC) – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its DDIC business used.
In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for, some time ago.
I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.
Isn’t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?
As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 – this is from a combination of
  more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.
However, $HIMX was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand.... and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.
$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.
So yes, for now – the demand will persist, and as management has said, this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage.
Now, that’s the background. Supply secured along with said demand.
SHORT SQUEEZE
Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear Short Squeeze candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 – and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the “GME X’mas special”.
So, why do I mention a ‘SHORT SQUEEZE’ – well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest
  is around 24.7m shares, representing ~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting ~11 days to cover.
However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.
Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of “short availability utilization”. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “GME X’mas special”.
 
 With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.
 https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) – so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.
  
 As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun’21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.
The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs.
I understand the short-thesis – I really do.
Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.
The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent
guidance seems to suggest otherwise.
I can personally find NO REASON to be short this stock anymore at least for the next 7 months, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4’21 and decent outlook for Q1’22) and then we will have a dividend payment in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).
From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.
The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.
But now, its time for a reversal.
   
 The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)
$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul’21).
The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been ~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.
So far, YTD Q3’21, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.
  An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!
That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.
The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July – so we have some time. But let’s face it, everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.
Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. An earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks.
Company has bought back shares previously – and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so I wouldn’t put a potential stock buyback past the company.
All in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen ~15% over the last few weeks, it’s quite a surprise that the stock hasn’t rallied much more.
More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).
A question from the “Growth Bros”: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?
A common question – and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.
  But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light. So, 2 points worth noting:
1. Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is ‘reinvestment’. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
   2. Reasonably capex-light business: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.
  Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

 - R&amp;D – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and
  - Capex - including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase
 In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their ‘investment phase’, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.
So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so, why hasn’t
  the share price gone up then?
Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.
Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20’s performance) as well.
Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.
  Hedge Funds’ share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 – when performance improved dramatically.
 
 Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.
Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.
So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn’t stock kept pace?
Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.
   Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. More on valuation at the end.
The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION! Folks believe that this stock is manipulated by Market Makers (MMs) who are often option sellers on $HIMX. Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed.
With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it’s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!
Q3 Earnings
Now – let’s discuss the recent earnings
Q3’21 revenue: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)
Q3’21 gross margin: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2’21 and vs 22.3% in Q3’20 (guidance was 50.5-52%) Q3’21 EBITDA: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here! Q3’21 Levered FCF of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.
  The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.
 
 Charts for annual performance incl LTM Sep’21 and YTD Sep’21 are shown below:
 So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.
 
 GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market
 Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.
Why was the market waiting on guidance? Because indications were that:
(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,
(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline) (c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)
 Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure......or at least that’s what the shorts were betting on.
Before I go into $HIMX’s guidance, let’s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) – which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4
+
its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:
 - Q4’21 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and
  - Q4’21 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.
 This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) – so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.
But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:
 - Q4 revenue would INCREASE by +4% to +8% q-o-q,
  - Gross margin: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)
  - Q4 IFRS EPS (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs
 prior year (Q4’20) of $0.195 → i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!
  - Q4 non IFRS EPS (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)
 Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!
To be fair, the margin decrease is more of a dilutionary effect than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.
“It’s simple math”, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX’s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.
 
 However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact.
But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through. In other words – earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.
This level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)
Mr. Lopez’s question is below:
 The answer to this question was pretty much that
a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 – FY19), and
   b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’.
  Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “again and
 again and again” (yes, 3 again’s specifically mentioned) – and notes that guidance this time is no different.
In fact, if you look at $HIMX’s historical guidance, you will see that the company has consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1’17) – and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.
 
 So yes – as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this “again and again and again”!!! Let’s just say management is highly credible.
Top line guidance by segment:
- Large DDIC – to GROW by high single digit q-o-q helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.
- Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC (overall) – GROW low teens q-o-q and &gt;50% yoy By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:
   - Smartphones -&gt; GROW high teens q-o-q &amp; &gt;30% yoy
 - Tablet -&gt; flat q-o-q, and
   - Automotive -&gt; GROW double-digit q-o-q and &gt;100% yoy. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX’s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.
 Interestingly within the Smartphone segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features”.
Also, and more importantly “successful engagements with some key customers have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches”. i.e. winning more market share.
Lots to like here.
Automotive is $HIMX’s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share. Company notes that the “increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle
is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle”.
Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need
 to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.
 
 As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC segment, which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.
This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application (industrial application, from what I gather) – which is on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures).
 In addition, $HIMX also notes that the number of awarded projects in this segment is growing rapidly, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical...”to name a few”. Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.
$HIMX also notes “within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company’s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from cloud service providers who look for secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services”. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.
$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year. This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future.
 
 VALUATION &amp; Conclusion
The chart below compares Himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.
However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers – with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.
The average fair value on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 – representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.
  As for transaction comps, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents 21x EV/EBITDA – which if applied to $HIMX, gives a FV of $54/share or +370% upside!
Is $54/share possible here? Absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a few steps ahead of competition with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its
 existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.
We haven’t even discussed $HIMX’s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long- term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).
But I’d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game”, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.
Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary – although, that is probably some time away.
For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.
Let’s squeeze this one dry. GME X’mas special.

7th November 2021
Welcome to the Yield Fanatic’s Trade Idea series. This write up is on the Taiwanese
semiconductor business, Himax. The shares are listed on NASDAQ and the ticker is $HIMX.
The date of write up is 7th November 2021 – as I write this, $HIMX’s current share price is $11.45 and market cap is roughly $2.0 billion. Note that this isn’t part of the deep dive series like I mostly present but rather a unique tactical trade idea given where this company trades at the moment.
But as always, before we start, the disclaimer. A few points worth noting:
Firstly, this is not investment advice nor is it a recommendation to buy or sell any security. This is just the Yield Fanatic’s opinion of the stock in question. If you wish to seek advice, please do so from an accredited financial advisor, which the Yield Fanatic is not.
Secondly, the opinion shown in this presentation is based on Yield’s read of things. Your view may be different based on your read of things, but it is the difference in views and opinion that makes a market.
The aim of this write up and recording is to give you an unbiased VIEW of the opportunity in question. The aim is to give you all the data that you need to make your own decision.
And finally, the Yield Fanatic does have a position in Himax at present and so, the opinions expressed here may be biased. This is a name that I have traded in the past and which I will continually trade in and out of.
To be clear, the Yield Fanatic does reserve to trade or invest in the name, subject to views and valuation at that specific point in time.
   Finally and before we start, note that this was originally written up for the purpose of posting on Reddit, so the tone may seem different to the one normally adopted on my other pieces of work.
 $HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present. TLDR:
 1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company – trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!
 The shares are cheap in a more “normal” S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as stupid cheap with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation
 2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.
3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4’21 and even Q1’22, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have consistently delivered

 results “to guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether.
 4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year – representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.
 5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.
  ..and now for the fun bit:
 6. Potential for a significant short squeeze. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were ~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to ~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.
 The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short – and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “GME X’mas special”.
7. Cant confirm this (unconfirmed hearsay) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up..... and it has already shot up ~15% last couple of weeks.
  Disclosure: I own stock + Jan’22 and Mar’22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan’22 and $10 Mar’22).
 
 What does $HIMX do? Products?
 Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here’s a quick snippet of what Himax does:
$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make ‘panels’ which are, in turn, used in:
 - Large sized DDICs -&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc
 - Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs -&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc
   In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:
- High end Timing Controller which improves power efficiency in displays
   - WiseEye ultra power AI --&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ AI and ML to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet
 of Things (IoT) area.
 
  - Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays – with usage in AR/VR glasses, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), Holographic Displays, etc.
 
- Other products in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)
  As a summary – the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:
 
Revenue by segment:
Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) – with Automotive OEM representing ~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs ~12.5%.
  However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.
The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.
  
 Competitors and Market Shares:
In the Q3’21 presentation (available here), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).
You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.
As for market share by the individual segments, as of Q3’21, $HIMX’s market shares were:
   - Large DDIC: 10.5%
  - Smartphones: 10.4%
 - Tablets: 37.7% but note that $HIMX has &gt; 60% market share of Android / non iOS tablets – the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.
   - Automotive OEM: 32.8%
  So, what has been happening recently with Himax?
2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.
Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products.
 
 $HIMX management foresaw that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes”, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.
When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially.... and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.
Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX
 found itself in a very sweet spot.
This gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked. When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players), $HIMX walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!
This allowed it to take a decent amount of market share over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.
So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?
$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) .....but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like Internet of Things (IoT) and Automotive/vehicles.
In addition, the modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV) would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.
   
 On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such 5G and high performance computing (HPC) – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its DDIC business used.
In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for, some time ago.
I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.
Isn’t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?
As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 – this is from a combination of
  more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.
However, $HIMX was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand.... and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.
$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.
So yes, for now – the demand will persist, and as management has said, this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage.
Now, that’s the background. Supply secured along with said demand.
SHORT SQUEEZE
Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear Short Squeeze candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 – and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the “GME X’mas special”.
So, why do I mention a ‘SHORT SQUEEZE’ – well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest
  is around 24.7m shares, representing ~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting ~11 days to cover.
However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.
Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of “short availability utilization”. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “GME X’mas special”.
 
 With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.
 https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) – so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.
  
 As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun’21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.
The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs.
I understand the short-thesis – I really do.
Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.
The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent
guidance seems to suggest otherwise.
I can personally find NO REASON to be short this stock anymore at least for the next 7 months, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4’21 and decent outlook for Q1’22) and then we will have a dividend payment in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).
From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.
The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.
But now, its time for a reversal.
   
 The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)
$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul’21).
The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been ~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.
So far, YTD Q3’21, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.
  An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!
That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.
The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July – so we have some time. But let’s face it, everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.
Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. An earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks.
Company has bought back shares previously – and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so I wouldn’t put a potential stock buyback past the company.
All in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen ~15% over the last few weeks, it’s quite a surprise that the stock hasn’t rallied much more.
More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).
A question from the “Growth Bros”: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?
A common question – and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.
  But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light. So, 2 points worth noting:
1. Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is ‘reinvestment’. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
   2. Reasonably capex-light business: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.
  Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

 - R&amp;D – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and
  - Capex - including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase
 In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their ‘investment phase’, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.
So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so, why hasn’t
  the share price gone up then?
Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.
Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20’s performance) as well.
Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.
  Hedge Funds’ share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 – when performance improved dramatically.
 
 Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.
Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.
So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn’t stock kept pace?
Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.
   Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. More on valuation at the end.
The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION! Folks believe that this stock is manipulated by Market Makers (MMs) who are often option sellers on $HIMX. Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed.
With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it’s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!
Q3 Earnings
Now – let’s discuss the recent earnings
Q3’21 revenue: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)
Q3’21 gross margin: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2’21 and vs 22.3% in Q3’20 (guidance was 50.5-52%) Q3’21 EBITDA: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here! Q3’21 Levered FCF of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.
  The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.
 
 Charts for annual performance incl LTM Sep’21 and YTD Sep’21 are shown below:
 So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.
 
 GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market
 Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.
Why was the market waiting on guidance? Because indications were that:
(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,
(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline) (c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)
 Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure......or at least that’s what the shorts were betting on.
Before I go into $HIMX’s guidance, let’s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) – which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4
+
its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:
 - Q4’21 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and
  - Q4’21 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.
 This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) – so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.
But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:
 - Q4 revenue would INCREASE by +4% to +8% q-o-q,
  - Gross margin: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)
  - Q4 IFRS EPS (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs
 prior year (Q4’20) of $0.195 → i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!
  - Q4 non IFRS EPS (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)
 Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!
To be fair, the margin decrease is more of a dilutionary effect than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.
“It’s simple math”, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX’s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.
 
 However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact.
But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through. In other words – earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.
This level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)
Mr. Lopez’s question is below:
 The answer to this question was pretty much that
a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 – FY19), and
   b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’.
  Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “again and
 again and again” (yes, 3 again’s specifically mentioned) – and notes that guidance this time is no different.
In fact, if you look at $HIMX’s historical guidance, you will see that the company has consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1’17) – and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.
 
 So yes – as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this “again and again and again”!!! Let’s just say management is highly credible.
Top line guidance by segment:
- Large DDIC – to GROW by high single digit q-o-q helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.
- Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC (overall) – GROW low teens q-o-q and &gt;50% yoy By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:
   - Smartphones -&gt; GROW high teens q-o-q &amp; &gt;30% yoy
 - Tablet -&gt; flat q-o-q, and
   - Automotive -&gt; GROW double-digit q-o-q and &gt;100% yoy. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX’s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.
 Interestingly within the Smartphone segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features”.
Also, and more importantly “successful engagements with some key customers have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches”. i.e. winning more market share.
Lots to like here.
Automotive is $HIMX’s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share. Company notes that the “increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle
is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle”.
Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need
 to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.
 
 As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC segment, which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.
This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application (industrial application, from what I gather) – which is on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures).
 In addition, $HIMX also notes that the number of awarded projects in this segment is growing rapidly, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical...”to name a few”. Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.
$HIMX also notes “within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company’s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from cloud service providers who look for secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services”. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.
$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year. This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future.
 
 VALUATION &amp; Conclusion
The chart below compares Himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.
However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers – with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.
The average fair value on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 – representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.
  As for transaction comps, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents 21x EV/EBITDA – which if applied to $HIMX, gives a FV of $54/share or +370% upside!
Is $54/share possible here? Absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a few steps ahead of competition with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its
 existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.
We haven’t even discussed $HIMX’s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long- term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).
But I’d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game”, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.
Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary – although, that is probably some time away.
For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.
Let’s squeeze this one dry. GME X’mas special.

Again, full credit to YieldFanatic as I’m too retarded to do a DD like this one. But to be fair I tried to tell you retards about HIMAX a while back. YieldFanatic’s DD is more on the spectrum than mine though;

7th November 2021
Welcome to the Yield Fanatic’s Trade Idea series. This write up is on the Taiwanese
semiconductor business, Himax. The shares are listed on NASDAQ and the ticker is $HIMX.
The date of write up is 7th November 2021 – as I write this, $HIMX’s current share price is $11.45 and market cap is roughly $2.0 billion. Note that this isn’t part of the deep dive series like I mostly present but rather a unique tactical trade idea given where this company trades at the moment.
But as always, before we start, the disclaimer. A few points worth noting:
Firstly, this is not investment advice nor is it a recommendation to buy or sell any security. This is just the Yield Fanatic’s opinion of the stock in question. If you wish to seek advice, please do so from an accredited financial advisor, which the Yield Fanatic is not.

   Finally and before we start, note that this was originally written up for the purpose of posting on Reddit, so the tone may seem different to the one normally adopted on my other pieces of work.
 $HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present. TLDR:
 1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company – trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!
 The shares are cheap in a more “normal” S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as stupid cheap with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation
 2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.
3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4’21 and even Q1’22, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have consistently delivered

 results “to guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether.
 4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year – representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.
 5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.
  ..and now for the fun bit:
 6. Potential for a significant short squeeze. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were ~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to ~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.
 The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short – and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “GME X’mas special”.
7. Cant confirm this (unconfirmed hearsay) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up..... and it has already shot up ~15% last couple of weeks.
  Disclosure: I own stock + Jan’22 and Mar’22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan’22 and $10 Mar’22).
 
 What does $HIMX do? Products?
 Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here’s a quick snippet of what Himax does:
$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make ‘panels’ which are, in turn, used in:
 - Large sized DDICs -&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc
 - Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs -&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc
   In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:
- High end Timing Controller which improves power efficiency in displays
   - WiseEye ultra power AI --&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ AI and ML to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet
 of Things (IoT) area.
 
  - Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays – with usage in AR/VR glasses, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), Holographic Displays, etc.
 
- Other products in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)
  As a summary – the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:
 
Revenue by segment:
Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) – with Automotive OEM representing ~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs ~12.5%.
  However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.
The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.
  
 Competitors and Market Shares:
In the Q3’21 presentation (available here), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).
You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.
As for market share by the individual segments, as of Q3’21, $HIMX’s market shares were:
   - Large DDIC: 10.5%
  - Smartphones: 10.4%
 - Tablets: 37.7% but note that $HIMX has &gt; 60% market share of Android / non iOS tablets – the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.
   - Automotive OEM: 32.8%
  So, what has been happening recently with Himax?
2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.
Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products.
 
 $HIMX management foresaw that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes”, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.
When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially.... and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.
Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX
 found itself in a very sweet spot.
This gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked. When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players), $HIMX walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!
This allowed it to take a decent amount of market share over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.
So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?
$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) .....but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like Internet of Things (IoT) and Automotive/vehicles.
In addition, the modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV) would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.
   
 On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such 5G and high performance computing (HPC) – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its DDIC business used.
In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for, some time ago.
I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.
Isn’t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?
As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 – this is from a combination of
  more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.
However, $HIMX was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand.... and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.
$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.
So yes, for now – the demand will persist, and as management has said, this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage.
Now, that’s the background. Supply secured along with said demand.
SHORT SQUEEZE
Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear Short Squeeze candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 – and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the “GME X’mas special”.
So, why do I mention a ‘SHORT SQUEEZE’ – well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest
  is around 24.7m shares, representing ~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting ~11 days to cover.
However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.
Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of “short availability utilization”. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “GME X’mas special”.
 
 With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.
 https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) – so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.
  
 As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun’21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.
The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs.
I understand the short-thesis – I really do.
Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.
The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent
guidance seems to suggest otherwise.
I can personally find NO REASON to be short this stock anymore at least for the next 7 months, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4’21 and decent outlook for Q1’22) and then we will have a dividend payment in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).
From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.
The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.
But now, its time for a reversal.
   
 The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)
$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul’21).
The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been ~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.
So far, YTD Q3’21, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.
  An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!
That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.
The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July – so we have some time. But let’s face it, everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.
Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. An earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks.
Company has bought back shares previously – and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so I wouldn’t put a potential stock buyback past the company.
All in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen ~15% over the last few weeks, it’s quite a surprise that the stock hasn’t rallied much more.
More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).
A question from the “Growth Bros”: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?
A common question – and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.
  But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light. So, 2 points worth noting:
1. Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is ‘reinvestment’. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
   2. Reasonably capex-light business: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.
  Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

 - R&amp;D – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and
  - Capex - including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase
 In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their ‘investment phase’, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.
So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so, why hasn’t
  the share price gone up then?
Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.
Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20’s performance) as well.
Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.
  Hedge Funds’ share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 – when performance improved dramatically.
 
 Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.
Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.
So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn’t stock kept pace?
Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.
   Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. More on valuation at the end.
The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION! Folks believe that this stock is manipulated by Market Makers (MMs) who are often option sellers on $HIMX. Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed.
With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it’s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!
Q3 Earnings
Now – let’s discuss the recent earnings
Q3’21 revenue: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)
Q3’21 gross margin: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2’21 and vs 22.3% in Q3’20 (guidance was 50.5-52%) Q3’21 EBITDA: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here! Q3’21 Levered FCF of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.
  The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.
 
 Charts for annual performance incl LTM Sep’21 and YTD Sep’21 are shown below:
 So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.
 
 GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market
 Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.
Why was the market waiting on guidance? Because indications were that:
(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,
(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline) (c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)
 Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure......or at least that’s what the shorts were betting on.
Before I go into $HIMX’s guidance, let’s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) – which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4
+
its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:
 - Q4’21 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and
  - Q4’21 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.
 This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) – so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.
But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:
 - Q4 revenue would INCREASE by +4% to +8% q-o-q,
  - Gross margin: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)
  - Q4 IFRS EPS (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs
 prior year (Q4’20) of $0.195 → i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!
  - Q4 non IFRS EPS (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)
 Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!
To be fair, the margin decrease is more of a dilutionary effect than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.
“It’s simple math”, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX’s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.
 
 However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact.
But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through. In other words – earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.
This level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)
Mr. Lopez’s question is below:
 The answer to this question was pretty much that
a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 – FY19), and
   b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’.
  Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “again and
 again and again” (yes, 3 again’s specifically mentioned) – and notes that guidance this time is no different.
In fact, if you look at $HIMX’s historical guidance, you will see that the company has consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1’17) – and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.
 
 So yes – as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this “again and again and again”!!! Let’s just say management is highly credible.
Top line guidance by segment:
- Large DDIC – to GROW by high single digit q-o-q helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.
- Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC (overall) – GROW low teens q-o-q and &gt;50% yoy By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:
   - Smartphones -&gt; GROW high teens q-o-q &amp; &gt;30% yoy
 - Tablet -&gt; flat q-o-q, and
   - Automotive -&gt; GROW double-digit q-o-q and &gt;100% yoy. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX’s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.
 Interestingly within the Smartphone segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features”.
Also, and more importantly “successful engagements with some key customers have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches”. i.e. winning more market share.
Lots to like here.
Automotive is $HIMX’s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share. Company notes that the “increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle
is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle”.
Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need
 to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.
 
 As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC segment, which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.
This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application (industrial application, from what I gather) – which is on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures).
 In addition, $HIMX also notes that the number of awarded projects in this segment is growing rapidly, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical...”to name a few”. Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.
$HIMX also notes “within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company’s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from cloud service providers who look for secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services”. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.
$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year. This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future.
 
 VALUATION &amp; Conclusion
The chart below compares Himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.
However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers – with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.
The average fair value on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 – representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.
  As for transaction comps, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents 21x EV/EBITDA – which if applied to $HIMX, gives a FV of $54/share or +370% upside!
Is $54/share possible here? Absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a few steps ahead of competition with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its
 existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.
We haven’t even discussed $HIMX’s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long- term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).
But I’d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game”, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.
Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary – although, that is probably some time away.
For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.
Let’s squeeze this one dry. GME X’mas special.

7th November 2021
Welcome to the Yield Fanatic’s Trade Idea series. This write up is on the Taiwanese
semiconductor business, Himax. The shares are listed on NASDAQ and the ticker is $HIMX.
The date of write up is 7th November 2021 – as I write this, $HIMX’s current share price is $11.45 and market cap is roughly $2.0 billion. Note that this isn’t part of the deep dive series like I mostly present but rather a unique tactical trade idea given where this company trades at the moment.
But as always, before we start, the disclaimer. A few points worth noting:
Firstly, this is not investment advice nor is it a recommendation to buy or sell any security. This is just the Yield Fanatic’s opinion of the stock in question. If you wish to seek advice, please do so from an accredited financial advisor, which the Yield Fanatic is not.
Secondly, the opinion shown in this presentation is based on Yield’s read of things. Your view may be different based on your read of things, but it is the difference in views and opinion that makes a market.
The aim of this write up and recording is to give you an unbiased VIEW of the opportunity in question. The aim is to give you all the data that you need to make your own decision.
And finally, the Yield Fanatic does have a position in Himax at present and so, the opinions expressed here may be biased. This is a name that I have traded in the past and which I will continually trade in and out of.
To be clear, the Yield Fanatic does reserve to trade or invest in the name, subject to views and valuation at that specific point in time.
   Finally and before we start, note that this was originally written up for the purpose of posting on Reddit, so the tone may seem different to the one normally adopted on my other pieces of work.
 $HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present. TLDR:
 1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company – trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!
 The shares are cheap in a more “normal” S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as stupid cheap with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation
 2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.
3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4’21 and even Q1’22, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have consistently delivered

 results “to guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether.
 4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year – representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.
 5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.
  ..and now for the fun bit:
 6. Potential for a significant short squeeze. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were ~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to ~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.
 The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short – and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “GME X’mas special”.
7. Cant confirm this (unconfirmed hearsay) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up..... and it has already shot up ~15% last couple of weeks.
  Disclosure: I own stock + Jan’22 and Mar’22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan’22 and $10 Mar’22).
 
 What does $HIMX do? Products?
 Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here’s a quick snippet of what Himax does:
$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make ‘panels’ which are, in turn, used in:
 - Large sized DDICs -&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc
 - Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs -&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc
   In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:
- High end Timing Controller which improves power efficiency in displays
   - WiseEye ultra power AI --&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ AI and ML to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet
 of Things (IoT) area.
 
  - Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays – with usage in AR/VR glasses, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), Holographic Displays, etc.
 
- Other products in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)
  As a summary – the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:
 
Revenue by segment:
Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) – with Automotive OEM representing ~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs ~12.5%.
  However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.
The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.
  
 Competitors and Market Shares:
In the Q3’21 presentation (available here), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).
You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.
As for market share by the individual segments, as of Q3’21, $HIMX’s market shares were:
   - Large DDIC: 10.5%
  - Smartphones: 10.4%
 - Tablets: 37.7% but note that $HIMX has &gt; 60% market share of Android / non iOS tablets – the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.
   - Automotive OEM: 32.8%
  So, what has been happening recently with Himax?
2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.
Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products.
 
 $HIMX management foresaw that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes”, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.
When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially.... and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.
Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX
 found itself in a very sweet spot.
This gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked. When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players), $HIMX walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!
This allowed it to take a decent amount of market share over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.
So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?
$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) .....but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like Internet of Things (IoT) and Automotive/vehicles.
In addition, the modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV) would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.
   
 On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such 5G and high performance computing (HPC) – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its DDIC business used.
In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for, some time ago.
I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.
Isn’t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?
As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 – this is from a combination of
  more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.
However, $HIMX was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand.... and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.
$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.
So yes, for now – the demand will persist, and as management has said, this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage.
Now, that’s the background. Supply secured along with said demand.
SHORT SQUEEZE
Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear Short Squeeze candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 – and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the “GME X’mas special”.
So, why do I mention a ‘SHORT SQUEEZE’ – well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest
  is around 24.7m shares, representing ~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting ~11 days to cover.
However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.
Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of “short availability utilization”. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “GME X’mas special”.
 
 With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.
 https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) – so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.
  
 As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun’21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.
The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs.
I understand the short-thesis – I really do.
Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.
The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent
guidance seems to suggest otherwise.
I can personally find NO REASON to be short this stock anymore at least for the next 7 months, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4’21 and decent outlook for Q1’22) and then we will have a dividend payment in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).
From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.
The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.
But now, its time for a reversal.
   
 The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)
$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul’21).
The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been ~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.
So far, YTD Q3’21, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.
  An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!
That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.
The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July – so we have some time. But let’s face it, everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.
Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. An earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks.
Company has bought back shares previously – and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so I wouldn’t put a potential stock buyback past the company.
All in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen ~15% over the last few weeks, it’s quite a surprise that the stock hasn’t rallied much more.
More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).
A question from the “Growth Bros”: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?
A common question – and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.
  But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light. So, 2 points worth noting:
1. Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is ‘reinvestment’. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
   2. Reasonably capex-light business: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.
  Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

 - R&amp;D – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and
  - Capex - including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase
 In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their ‘investment phase’, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.
So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so, why hasn’t
  the share price gone up then?
Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.
Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20’s performance) as well.
Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.
  Hedge Funds’ share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 – when performance improved dramatically.
 
 Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.
Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.
So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn’t stock kept pace?
Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.
   Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. More on valuation at the end.
The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION! Folks believe that this stock is manipulated by Market Makers (MMs) who are often option sellers on $HIMX. Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed.
With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it’s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!
Q3 Earnings
Now – let’s discuss the recent earnings
Q3’21 revenue: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)
Q3’21 gross margin: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2’21 and vs 22.3% in Q3’20 (guidance was 50.5-52%) Q3’21 EBITDA: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here! Q3’21 Levered FCF of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.
  The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.
 
 Charts for annual performance incl LTM Sep’21 and YTD Sep’21 are shown below:
 So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.
 
 GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market
 Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.
Why was the market waiting on guidance? Because indications were that:
(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,
(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline) (c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)
 Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure......or at least that’s what the shorts were betting on.
Before I go into $HIMX’s guidance, let’s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) – which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4
+
its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:
 - Q4’21 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and
  - Q4’21 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.
 This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) – so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.
But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:
 - Q4 revenue would INCREASE by +4% to +8% q-o-q,
  - Gross margin: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)
  - Q4 IFRS EPS (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs
 prior year (Q4’20) of $0.195 → i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!
  - Q4 non IFRS EPS (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)
 Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!
To be fair, the margin decrease is more of a dilutionary effect than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.
“It’s simple math”, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX’s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.
 
 However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact.
But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through. In other words – earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.
This level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)
Mr. Lopez’s question is below:
 The answer to this question was pretty much that
a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 – FY19), and
   b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’.
  Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “again and
 again and again” (yes, 3 again’s specifically mentioned) – and notes that guidance this time is no different.
In fact, if you look at $HIMX’s historical guidance, you will see that the company has consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1’17) – and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.
 
 So yes – as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this “again and again and again”!!! Let’s just say management is highly credible.
Top line guidance by segment:
- Large DDIC – to GROW by high single digit q-o-q helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.
- Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC (overall) – GROW low teens q-o-q and &gt;50% yoy By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:
   - Smartphones -&gt; GROW high teens q-o-q &amp; &gt;30% yoy
 - Tablet -&gt; flat q-o-q, and
   - Automotive -&gt; GROW double-digit q-o-q and &gt;100% yoy. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX’s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.
 Interestingly within the Smartphone segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features”.
Also, and more importantly “successful engagements with some key customers have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches”. i.e. winning more market share.
Lots to like here.
Automotive is $HIMX’s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share. Company notes that the “increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle
is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle”.
Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need
 to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.
 
 As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC segment, which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.
This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application (industrial application, from what I gather) – which is on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures).
 In addition, $HIMX also notes that the number of awarded projects in this segment is growing rapidly, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical...”to name a few”. Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.
$HIMX also notes “within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company’s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from cloud service providers who look for secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services”. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.
$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year. This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future.
 
 VALUATION &amp; Conclusion
The chart below compares Himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.
However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers – with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.
The average fair value on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 – representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.
  As for transaction comps, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents 21x EV/EBITDA – which if applied to $HIMX, gives a FV of $54/share or +370% upside!
Is $54/share possible here? Absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a few steps ahead of competition with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its
 existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.
We haven’t even discussed $HIMX’s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long- term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).
But I’d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game”, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.
Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary – although, that is probably some time away.
For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.
Let’s squeeze this one dry. GME X’mas special.

th June The increase stock price squeezed short significantly saw stock rally cool odd I think see shortly uncertainty removed could rally much much higher previous high I understand short thesis I really Potential sale decline end consumer demand certain product falling alongside margin pressure foundry HIMX supplier raise price could created perfect doomsday scenario putting huge pressure stock price That good fair thesis The whole short thesis predicated potential reversal performance recent guidance seems suggest otherwise I personally find NO REASON short stock anymore least next month especially given solid guidance We pretty much clarity next quarter full guidance Q decent outlook Q dividend payment July record date usually Jun From I hear mind unconfirmed hearsay much short position held Asian hedge fund increasing short position ahead earnings The short interest jumped share th June dividend record date th October The share price turn collapsed closing price th June low th October But time reversal The Dividend maybe even stock buyback HIMX historically paid EPS dividend For FY HIMX paid IFRS fully diluted EPS dividend paid Jul The average payout since FY FY Fair assume payout IFRS fully diluted EPS continues year So far YTD Q IFRS fully diluted EPS Company recently gave Q guidance Assuming mid point guidance arrive potential fully diluted EPS FY share An payout mean dividend share represents dividend yield given share price today That dear friend crazy cost short The dividend usually declared June paid July time But let face everyone math long institution jump band wagon Now course assuming fund distributed dividend An earlier distribution also likely potentially share buyback Company bought back share previously honest share look ridiculously cheap given performance I put potential stock buyback past company All significant upward pressure price although share already risen last week quite surprise stock rallied much More valuation later end write A question Growth Bros paying dividend mean business grow A common question I get Not many dividend paying business grow like HIMX Understandable But note HIMX DDIC peer fable design house meaning capex light So point worth noting Dividend based EPS net R amp D expense gt reinvestment R amp D spent new product innovation upgrade mostly Reasonably capex light business HIMX fable involve significant amount capex Also HIMX invested significantly R amp D capex FY FY given expectation potential surge demand product Specifically focussed developing new product line upgrading existing product R amp D including spend upgrade existing product line move towards higher quality product range like product K K TVs well focus developing new product non DDIC business Capex including payment secure additional foundry capacity well expansion existing production capability existing product including land purchase In word year pain FY FY effectively investment phase HIMX shareholder enjoying fruit hard earned labour today So performance great massive shareholder distribution coming share price gone Well question still haunt longs name Performance valuation side company reinstated dividend FY performance well Perhaps answer stock predominantly owned traded retail investor However changing hedge fund institution getting involved The chart show change time Hedge Funds share increased outstanding stock today institutional incl mutual fund ownership increased FY today Note much increase came FY FY performance improved dramatically Much attributed company actively marketing attending conference pitching institution The institutional HF participation set increase opinion Also note founder CEO family owns company So performance getting better institutional ownership improving stock kept pace Well firstly stock climbed significantly since jumped mere share share today The high stock th June price since declined despite performance improving Although share price increased performance much better valuation today still significantly cheaper v peer More valuation end The belief amongst longs MANIPULATION Folks believe stock manipulated Market Makers MMs often option seller HIMX Retail trade option much actively stock giving incentive MMs keep stock price depressed With performance outlook well potential stockholder distribution divi stock buyback side time TAKE BACK CONTROL Q Earnings Now let discus recent earnings Q revenue yoy q q guidance q q Q gross margin v Q v Q guidance Q EBITDA x yoy q q impact operating leverage clearly visible Q Levered FCF bringing YTD FCF The chart show quarterly performance clearly Charts annual performance incl LTM Sep YTD Sep shown So Q result came higher end guidance Excellent GUIDANCE positively surprising market Performance going decent However Q guidance market eagerly waiting short keeping close eye Why market waiting guidance Because indication consumer demand TV smartphones fading b panel maker feeling pain e HIMX customer seeing pricing decline c foundry raising price e HIMX supplier raising price Worries around cost increase fading demand would mean mix topline AND margin pressure least short betting Before I go HIMX guidance let say market following panel maker HIMX customer guiding lower volume Q nearest largest competitor Novatek released guidance Thursday th Nov morning stating Q revenue would decline q q Q gross margin would decline registered Q This Novatek guidance better market feared Novatek stock rose Taiwan waiting HIMX report something similar But HIMX KILLED IT Why It reported Q revenue would INCREASE q q Gross margin would fall around reported Q Q IFRS EPS dividend based YTD already v prior year Q e forecast grow roughly x Q non IFRS EPS adjusted non recurring item SBC v prior year Q x roughly Yes margin marginally e foundry raising price one expected growth revenue coming To fair margin decrease dilutionary effect cost increase impact HIMX passing price increase customer anyway It simple math CEO explained call He noted original foundry cost HIMX selling price gt gross margin would However foundry raised price HIMX passed customer selling price increased margin would gt dilutionary impact rather pure profitability impact But I said earlier one expected growth revenue coming In word earnings good guidance took market surprise This level surprise best encapsulated question Vertical Group analyst Jon Lopez analyst SELL rating HIMX target expectation bad Q perhaps Mr Lopez question The answer question pretty much HIMX giving lot lower end business price competition rampant return higher end HQ business get industry recognition company aggressively investing product suite upgrade FY FY b HIMX building relationship top tier brand directly rather going panel maker making demand product defensive Management also alluded proven sale performance v guidance yes specifically mentioned note guidance time different In fact look HIMX historical guidance see company consistently delivered earnings within guidance least last quarter since Q case either higher end guidance beat altogether So yes CEO Jordan Wu note company history delivering beating guidance shown Let say management highly credible Top line guidance segment Large DDIC GROW high single digit q q helped growth notebook monitor although TV sale drop slightly due softer end market However HIMX remains positive large DDIC given shortage wafer capacity Small amp Mid sized DDIC overall GROW low teen q q gt yoy By sub segment within small amp mid sized DDIC Smartphones gt GROW high teen q q amp gt yoy Tablet gt flat q q Automotive gt GROW double digit q q gt yoy Stalled capacity restricting HIMX ability meet customer demand significant shortage still persists Interestingly within Smartphone segment HIMX mkt share company note undertaking new design development supporting higher frame rate ultra slim bezel higher resolution feature Also importantly successful engagement key customer achieved Q customer indicating interest next launch e winning market share Lots like Automotive HIMX highest growth area hold growing market share Company note increase number size sophistication display inside vehicle evolving rapid rate indicating much DDIC demand per vehicle Not going write extract Q earnings tell everything need know show positive future business within segment As noted earlier HIMX also non DDIC segment expected decline Q expected significant growth contributor onwards higher margin This segment includes component AR VR amp IoT application This longer term area worth watching adoption increase last quarter HIMX reported design win top tier name mainstream application industrial application I gather track enter mass production Q result visible figure In addition HIMX also note number awarded project segment growing rapidly covering broad range application including notebook home appliance utility meter automotive battery surveillance camera panoramic video conferencing medical name Some application already slated mass production end year meaning see benefit coming HIMX also note within year since HIMX started sampling company WiseEye solution also drawn much attention cloud service provider look secure low power edge AI device help collect big data cloud based service This open new market frontier area like smart city smart office healthcare agriculture retail factory automation HIMX anticipates design win award growing volume shipment starting next year This segment drive lot growth business future VALUATION amp Conclusion The chart compare Himax valuation v peer note competitor division apart DDIC make direct comp However metric LTM basis HIMX screen much cheaper v peer minimum upside Upside using traded comparables representing fair value share v today The average fair value traded comparables HIMX share representing upside v current share price As transaction comp South Korean DDIC business Magnachip MX US currently subject takeover offer Chinese private equity Wise Road Capital share US government trying stop This offer represents x EV EBITDA applied HIMX give FV share upside Is share possible Absolutely business growing nearest competitor Novatek actually declining This business invested future step ahead competition respect developing new product well upgrading existing product suite building direct relationship end brand We even discussed HIMX potential growth AR VR even mid long term plan nothing imminent next year But I say foot door already mean remain relevant game whether game physical digital even METAVERSE Yes Metaverse beneficiary although probably time away For I rest case Good business excellent valuation potential massive short

Again, full credit to YieldFanatic and YieldFanatic.com as I’m too retarded to do a DD like this one. But to be fair I tried to tell you retards about HIMAX a while back. YieldFanatic’s DD is more on the spectrum than mine though;


(Images missing)
7th November 2021
Welcome to the Yield Fanatic’s Trade Idea series. This write up is on the Taiwanese
semiconductor business, Himax. The shares are listed on NASDAQ and the ticker is $HIMX.
The date of write up is 7th November 2021 – as I write this, $HIMX’s current share price is $11.45 and market cap is roughly $2.0 billion. Note that this isn’t part of the deep dive series like I mostly present but rather a unique tactical trade idea given where this company trades at the moment.
But as always, before we start, the disclaimer. A few points worth noting:
Firstly, this is not investment advice nor is it a recommendation to buy or sell any security. This is just the Yield Fanatic’s opinion of the stock in question. If you wish to seek advice, please do so from an accredited financial advisor, which the Yield Fanatic is not.
Secondly, the opinion shown in this presentation is based on Yield’s read of things. Your view may be different based on your read of things, but it is the difference in views and opinion that makes a market.
The aim of this write up and recording is to give you an unbiased VIEW of the opportunity in question. The aim is to give you all the data that you need to make your own decision.
And finally, the Yield Fanatic does have a position in Himax at present and so, the opinions expressed here may be biased. This is a name that I have traded in the past and which I will continually trade in and out of.
To be clear, the Yield Fanatic does reserve to trade or invest in the name, subject to views and valuation at that specific point in time.
   Finally and before we start, note that this was originally written up for the purpose of posting on Reddit, so the tone may seem different to the one normally adopted on my other pieces of work.
 $HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present. TLDR:
 1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company – trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!
 The shares are cheap in a more “normal” S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as stupid cheap with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation
 2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.
3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4’21 and even Q1’22, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have consistently delivered

 results “to guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether.
 4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year – representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.
 5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.
  ..and now for the fun bit:
 6. Potential for a significant short squeeze. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were ~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to ~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.
 The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short – and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “GME X’mas special”.
7. Cant confirm this (unconfirmed hearsay) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up..... and it has already shot up ~15% last couple of weeks.
  Disclosure: I own stock + Jan’22 and Mar’22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan’22 and $10 Mar’22).
 
 What does $HIMX do? Products?
 Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here’s a quick snippet of what Himax does:
$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make ‘panels’ which are, in turn, used in:
 - Large sized DDICs -&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc
 - Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs -&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc
   In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:
- High end Timing Controller which improves power efficiency in displays
   - WiseEye ultra power AI --&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ AI and ML to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet
 of Things (IoT) area.
 
  - Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays – with usage in AR/VR glasses, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), Holographic Displays, etc.
 
- Other products in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)
  As a summary – the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:
 
Revenue by segment:
Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) – with Automotive OEM representing ~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs ~12.5%.
  However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.
The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.
  
 Competitors and Market Shares:
In the Q3’21 presentation (available here), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).
You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.
As for market share by the individual segments, as of Q3’21, $HIMX’s market shares were:
   - Large DDIC: 10.5%
  - Smartphones: 10.4%
 - Tablets: 37.7% but note that $HIMX has &gt; 60% market share of Android / non iOS tablets – the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.
   - Automotive OEM: 32.8%
  So, what has been happening recently with Himax?
2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.
Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products.
 
 $HIMX management foresaw that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes”, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.
When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially.... and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.
Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX
 found itself in a very sweet spot.
This gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked. When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players), $HIMX walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!
This allowed it to take a decent amount of market share over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.
So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?
$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) .....but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like Internet of Things (IoT) and Automotive/vehicles.
In addition, the modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV) would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.
   
 On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such 5G and high performance computing (HPC) – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its DDIC business used.
In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for, some time ago.
I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.
Isn’t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?
As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 – this is from a combination of
  more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.
However, $HIMX was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand.... and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.
$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.
So yes, for now – the demand will persist, and as management has said, this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage.
Now, that’s the background. Supply secured along with said demand.
SHORT SQUEEZE
Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear Short Squeeze candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 – and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the “GME X’mas special”.
So, why do I mention a ‘SHORT SQUEEZE’ – well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest
  is around 24.7m shares, representing ~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting ~11 days to cover.
However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.
Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of “short availability utilization”. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “GME X’mas special”.
 
 With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.
 https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) – so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.
  
 As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun’21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.
The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs.
I understand the short-thesis – I really do.
Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.
The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent
guidance seems to suggest otherwise.
I can personally find NO REASON to be short this stock anymore at least for the next 7 months, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4’21 and decent outlook for Q1’22) and then we will have a dividend payment in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).
From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.
The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.
But now, its time for a reversal.
   
 The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)
$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul’21).
The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been ~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.
So far, YTD Q3’21, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.
  An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!
That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.
The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July – so we have some time. But let’s face it, everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.
Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. An earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks.
Company has bought back shares previously – and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so I wouldn’t put a potential stock buyback past the company.
All in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen ~15% over the last few weeks, it’s quite a surprise that the stock hasn’t rallied much more.
More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).
A question from the “Growth Bros”: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?
A common question – and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.
  But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light. So, 2 points worth noting:
1. Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is ‘reinvestment’. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
   2. Reasonably capex-light business: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.
  Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

 - R&amp;D – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and
  - Capex - including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase
 In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their ‘investment phase’, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.
So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so, why hasn’t
  the share price gone up then?
Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.
Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20’s performance) as well.
Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.
  Hedge Funds’ share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 – when performance improved dramatically.
 
 Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.
Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.
So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn’t stock kept pace?
Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.
   Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. More on valuation at the end.
The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION! Folks believe that this stock is manipulated by Market Makers (MMs) who are often option sellers on $HIMX. Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed.
With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it’s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!
Q3 Earnings
Now – let’s discuss the recent earnings
Q3’21 revenue: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)
Q3’21 gross margin: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2’21 and vs 22.3% in Q3’20 (guidance was 50.5-52%) Q3’21 EBITDA: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here! Q3’21 Levered FCF of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.
  The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.
 
 Charts for annual performance incl LTM Sep’21 and YTD Sep’21 are shown below:
 So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.
 
 GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market
 Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.
Why was the market waiting on guidance? Because indications were that:
(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,
(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline) (c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)
 Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure......or at least that’s what the shorts were betting on.
Before I go into $HIMX’s guidance, let’s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) – which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4
+
its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:
 - Q4’21 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and
  - Q4’21 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.
 This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) – so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.
But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:
 - Q4 revenue would INCREASE by +4% to +8% q-o-q,
  - Gross margin: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)
  - Q4 IFRS EPS (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs
 prior year (Q4’20) of $0.195 → i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!
  - Q4 non IFRS EPS (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)
 Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!
To be fair, the margin decrease is more of a dilutionary effect than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.
“It’s simple math”, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX’s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.
 
 However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact.
But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through. In other words – earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.
This level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)
Mr. Lopez’s question is below:
 The answer to this question was pretty much that
a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 – FY19), and
   b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’.
  Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “again and
 again and again” (yes, 3 again’s specifically mentioned) – and notes that guidance this time is no different.
In fact, if you look at $HIMX’s historical guidance, you will see that the company has consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1’17) – and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.
 
 So yes – as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this “again and again and again”!!! Let’s just say management is highly credible.
Top line guidance by segment:
- Large DDIC – to GROW by high single digit q-o-q helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.
- Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC (overall) – GROW low teens q-o-q and &gt;50% yoy By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:
   - Smartphones -&gt; GROW high teens q-o-q &amp; &gt;30% yoy
 - Tablet -&gt; flat q-o-q, and
   - Automotive -&gt; GROW double-digit q-o-q and &gt;100% yoy. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX’s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.
 Interestingly within the Smartphone segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features”.
Also, and more importantly “successful engagements with some key customers have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches”. i.e. winning more market share.
Lots to like here.
Automotive is $HIMX’s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share. Company notes that the “increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle
is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle”.
Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need
 to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.
 
 As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC segment, which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.
This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application (industrial application, from what I gather) – which is on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures).
 In addition, $HIMX also notes that the number of awarded projects in this segment is growing rapidly, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical...”to name a few”. Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.
$HIMX also notes “within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company’s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from cloud service providers who look for secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services”. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.
$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year. This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future.
 
 VALUATION &amp; Conclusion
The chart below compares Himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.
However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers – with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.
The average fair value on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 – representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.
  As for transaction comps, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents 21x EV/EBITDA – which if applied to $HIMX, gives a FV of $54/share or +370% upside!
Is $54/share possible here? Absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a few steps ahead of competition with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its
 existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.
We haven’t even discussed $HIMX’s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long- term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).
But I’d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game”, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.
Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary – although, that is probably some time away.
For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.
Let’s squeeze this one dry. GME X’mas special.

7th November 2021
Welcome to the Yield Fanatic’s Trade Idea series. This write up is on the Taiwanese
semiconductor business, Himax. The shares are listed on NASDAQ and the ticker is $HIMX.
The date of write up is 7th November 2021 – as I write this, $HIMX’s current share price is $11.45 and market cap is roughly $2.0 billion. Note that this isn’t part of the deep dive series like I mostly present but rather a unique tactical trade idea given where this company trades at the moment.
But as always, before we start, the disclaimer. A few points worth noting:
Firstly, this is not investment advice nor is it a recommendation to buy or sell any security. This is just the Yield Fanatic’s opinion of the stock in question. If you wish to seek advice, please do so from an accredited financial advisor, which the Yield Fanatic is not.
Secondly, the opinion shown in this presentation is based on Yield’s read of things. Your view may be different based on your read of things, but it is the difference in views and opinion that makes a market.
The aim of this write up and recording is to give you an unbiased VIEW of the opportunity in question. The aim is to give you all the data that you need to make your own decision.
And finally, the Yield Fanatic does have a position in Himax at present and so, the opinions expressed here may be biased. This is a name that I have traded in the past and which I will continually trade in and out of.
To be clear, the Yield Fanatic does reserve to trade or invest in the name, subject to views and valuation at that specific point in time.
   Finally and before we start, note that this was originally written up for the purpose of posting on Reddit, so the tone may seem different to the one normally adopted on my other pieces of work.
 $HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present. TLDR:
 1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company – trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!
 The shares are cheap in a more “normal” S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as stupid cheap with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation
 2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.
3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4’21 and even Q1’22, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have consistently delivered

 results “to guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether.
 4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year – representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.
 5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.
  ..and now for the fun bit:
 6. Potential for a significant short squeeze. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were ~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to ~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.
 The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short – and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “GME X’mas special”.
7. Cant confirm this (unconfirmed hearsay) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up..... and it has already shot up ~15% last couple of weeks.
  Disclosure: I own stock + Jan’22 and Mar’22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan’22 and $10 Mar’22).
 
 What does $HIMX do? Products?
 Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here’s a quick snippet of what Himax does:
$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make ‘panels’ which are, in turn, used in:
 - Large sized DDICs -&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc
 - Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs -&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc
   In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:
- High end Timing Controller which improves power efficiency in displays
   - WiseEye ultra power AI --&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ AI and ML to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet
 of Things (IoT) area.
 
  - Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays – with usage in AR/VR glasses, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), Holographic Displays, etc.
 
- Other products in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)
  As a summary – the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:
 
Revenue by segment:
Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) – with Automotive OEM representing ~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs ~12.5%.
  However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.
The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.
  
 Competitors and Market Shares:
In the Q3’21 presentation (available here), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).
You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.
As for market share by the individual segments, as of Q3’21, $HIMX’s market shares were:
   - Large DDIC: 10.5%
  - Smartphones: 10.4%
 - Tablets: 37.7% but note that $HIMX has &gt; 60% market share of Android / non iOS tablets – the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.
   - Automotive OEM: 32.8%
  So, what has been happening recently with Himax?
2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.
Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products.
 
 $HIMX management foresaw that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes”, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.
When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially.... and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.
Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX
 found itself in a very sweet spot.
This gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked. When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players), $HIMX walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!
This allowed it to take a decent amount of market share over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.
So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?
$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) .....but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like Internet of Things (IoT) and Automotive/vehicles.
In addition, the modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV) would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.
   
 On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such 5G and high performance computing (HPC) – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its DDIC business used.
In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for, some time ago.
I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.
Isn’t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?
As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 – this is from a combination of
  more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.
However, $HIMX was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand.... and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.
$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.
So yes, for now – the demand will persist, and as management has said, this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage.
Now, that’s the background. Supply secured along with said demand.
SHORT SQUEEZE
Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear Short Squeeze candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 – and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the “GME X’mas special”.
So, why do I mention a ‘SHORT SQUEEZE’ – well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest
  is around 24.7m shares, representing ~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting ~11 days to cover.
However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.
Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of “short availability utilization”. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “GME X’mas special”.
 
 With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.
 https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) – so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.
  
 As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun’21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.
The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs.
I understand the short-thesis – I really do.
Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.
The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent
guidance seems to suggest otherwise.
I can personally find NO REASON to be short this stock anymore at least for the next 7 months, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4’21 and decent outlook for Q1’22) and then we will have a dividend payment in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).
From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.
The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.
But now, its time for a reversal.
   
 The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)
$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul’21).
The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been ~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.
So far, YTD Q3’21, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.
  An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!
That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.
The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July – so we have some time. But let’s face it, everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.
Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. An earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks.
Company has bought back shares previously – and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so I wouldn’t put a potential stock buyback past the company.
All in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen ~15% over the last few weeks, it’s quite a surprise that the stock hasn’t rallied much more.
More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).
A question from the “Growth Bros”: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?
A common question – and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.
  But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light. So, 2 points worth noting:
1. Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is ‘reinvestment’. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
   2. Reasonably capex-light business: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.
  Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

 - R&amp;D – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and
  - Capex - including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase
 In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their ‘investment phase’, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.
So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so, why hasn’t
  the share price gone up then?
Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.
Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20’s performance) as well.
Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.
  Hedge Funds’ share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 – when performance improved dramatically.
 
 Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.
Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.
So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn’t stock kept pace?
Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.
   Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. More on valuation at the end.
The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION! Folks believe that this stock is manipulated by Market Makers (MMs) who are often option sellers on $HIMX. Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed.
With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it’s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!
Q3 Earnings
Now – let’s discuss the recent earnings
Q3’21 revenue: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)
Q3’21 gross margin: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2’21 and vs 22.3% in Q3’20 (guidance was 50.5-52%) Q3’21 EBITDA: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here! Q3’21 Levered FCF of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.
  The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.
 
 Charts for annual performance incl LTM Sep’21 and YTD Sep’21 are shown below:
 So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.
 
 GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market
 Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.
Why was the market waiting on guidance? Because indications were that:
(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,
(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline) (c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)
 Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure......or at least that’s what the shorts were betting on.
Before I go into $HIMX’s guidance, let’s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) – which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4
+
its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:
 - Q4’21 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and
  - Q4’21 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.
 This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) – so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.
But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:
 - Q4 revenue would INCREASE by +4% to +8% q-o-q,
  - Gross margin: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)
  - Q4 IFRS EPS (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs
 prior year (Q4’20) of $0.195 → i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!
  - Q4 non IFRS EPS (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)
 Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!
To be fair, the margin decrease is more of a dilutionary effect than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.
“It’s simple math”, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX’s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.
 
 However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact.
But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through. In other words – earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.
This level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)
Mr. Lopez’s question is below:
 The answer to this question was pretty much that
a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 – FY19), and
   b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’.
  Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “again and
 again and again” (yes, 3 again’s specifically mentioned) – and notes that guidance this time is no different.
In fact, if you look at $HIMX’s historical guidance, you will see that the company has consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1’17) – and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.
 
 So yes – as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this “again and again and again”!!! Let’s just say management is highly credible.
Top line guidance by segment:
- Large DDIC – to GROW by high single digit q-o-q helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.
- Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC (overall) – GROW low teens q-o-q and &gt;50% yoy By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:
   - Smartphones -&gt; GROW high teens q-o-q &amp; &gt;30% yoy
 - Tablet -&gt; flat q-o-q, and
   - Automotive -&gt; GROW double-digit q-o-q and &gt;100% yoy. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX’s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.
 Interestingly within the Smartphone segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features”.
Also, and more importantly “successful engagements with some key customers have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches”. i.e. winning more market share.
Lots to like here.
Automotive is $HIMX’s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share. Company notes that the “increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle
is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle”.
Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need
 to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.
 
 As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC segment, which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.
This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application (industrial application, from what I gather) – which is on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures).
 In addition, $HIMX also notes that the number of awarded projects in this segment is growing rapidly, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical...”to name a few”. Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.
$HIMX also notes “within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company’s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from cloud service providers who look for secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services”. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.
$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year. This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future.
 
 VALUATION &amp; Conclusion
The chart below compares Himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.
However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers – with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.
The average fair value on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 – representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.
  As for transaction comps, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents 21x EV/EBITDA – which if applied to $HIMX, gives a FV of $54/share or +370% upside!
Is $54/share possible here? Absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a few steps ahead of competition with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its
 existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.
We haven’t even discussed $HIMX’s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long- term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).
But I’d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game”, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.
Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary – although, that is probably some time away.
For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.
Let’s squeeze this one dry. GME X’mas special.

Again, full credit to YieldFanatic as I’m too retarded to do a DD like this one. But to be fair I tried to tell you retards about HIMAX a while back. YieldFanatic’s DD is more on the spectrum than mine though;


Himax Trade Idea - Script (Images missing)
7th November 2021
Welcome to the Yield Fanatic’s Trade Idea series. This write up is on the Taiwanese
semiconductor business, Himax. The shares are listed on NASDAQ and the ticker is $HIMX.
The date of write up is 7th November 2021 – as I write this, $HIMX’s current share price is $11.45 and market cap is roughly $2.0 billion. Note that this isn’t part of the deep dive series like I mostly present but rather a unique tactical trade idea given where this company trades at the moment.
But as always, before we start, the disclaimer. A few points worth noting:
Firstly, this is not investment advice nor is it a recommendation to buy or sell any security. This is just the Yield Fanatic’s opinion of the stock in question. If you wish to seek advice, please do so from an accredited financial advisor, which the Yield Fanatic is not.
Secondly, the opinion shown in this presentation is based on Yield’s read of things. Your view may be different based on your read of things, but it is the difference in views and opinion that makes a market.
The aim of this write up and recording is to give you an unbiased VIEW of the opportunity in question. The aim is to give you all the data that you need to make your own decision.
And finally, the Yield Fanatic does have a position in Himax at present and so, the opinions expressed here may be biased. This is a name that I have traded in the past and which I will continually trade in and out of.
To be clear, the Yield Fanatic does reserve to trade or invest in the name, subject to views and valuation at that specific point in time.
   Finally and before we start, note that this was originally written up for the purpose of posting on Reddit, so the tone may seem different to the one normally adopted on my other pieces of work.
 $HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present. TLDR:
 1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company – trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!
 The shares are cheap in a more “normal” S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as stupid cheap with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation
 2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.
3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4’21 and even Q1’22, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have consistently delivered

 results “to guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether.
 4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year – representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.
 5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.
  ..and now for the fun bit:
 6. Potential for a significant short squeeze. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were ~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to ~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.
 The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short – and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “GME X’mas special”.
7. Cant confirm this (unconfirmed hearsay) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up..... and it has already shot up ~15% last couple of weeks.
  Disclosure: I own stock + Jan’22 and Mar’22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan’22 and $10 Mar’22).
 
 What does $HIMX do? Products?
 Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here’s a quick snippet of what Himax does:
$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make ‘panels’ which are, in turn, used in:
 - Large sized DDICs -&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc
 - Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs -&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc
   In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:
- High end Timing Controller which improves power efficiency in displays
   - WiseEye ultra power AI --&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ AI and ML to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet
 of Things (IoT) area.
 
  - Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays – with usage in AR/VR glasses, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), Holographic Displays, etc.
 
- Other products in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)
  As a summary – the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:
 
Revenue by segment:
Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) – with Automotive OEM representing ~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs ~12.5%.
  However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.
The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.
  
 Competitors and Market Shares:
In the Q3’21 presentation (available here), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).
You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.
As for market share by the individual segments, as of Q3’21, $HIMX’s market shares were:
   - Large DDIC: 10.5%
  - Smartphones: 10.4%
 - Tablets: 37.7% but note that $HIMX has &gt; 60% market share of Android / non iOS tablets – the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.
   - Automotive OEM: 32.8%
  So, what has been happening recently with Himax?
2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.
Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products.
 
 $HIMX management foresaw that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes”, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.
When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially.... and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.
Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX
 found itself in a very sweet spot.
This gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked. When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players), $HIMX walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!
This allowed it to take a decent amount of market share over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.
So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?
$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) .....but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like Internet of Things (IoT) and Automotive/vehicles.
In addition, the modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV) would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.
   
 On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such 5G and high performance computing (HPC) – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its DDIC business used.
In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for, some time ago.
I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.
Isn’t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?
As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 – this is from a combination of
  more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.
However, $HIMX was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand.... and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.
$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.
So yes, for now – the demand will persist, and as management has said, this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage.
Now, that’s the background. Supply secured along with said demand.
SHORT SQUEEZE
Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear Short Squeeze candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 – and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the “GME X’mas special”.
So, why do I mention a ‘SHORT SQUEEZE’ – well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest
  is around 24.7m shares, representing ~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting ~11 days to cover.
However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.
Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of “short availability utilization”. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “GME X’mas special”.
 
 With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.
 https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) – so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.
  
 As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun’21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.
The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs.
I understand the short-thesis – I really do.
Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.
The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent
guidance seems to suggest otherwise.
I can personally find NO REASON to be short this stock anymore at least for the next 7 months, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4’21 and decent outlook for Q1’22) and then we will have a dividend payment in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).
From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.
The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.
But now, its time for a reversal.
   
 The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)
$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul’21).
The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been ~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.
So far, YTD Q3’21, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.
  An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!
That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.
The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July – so we have some time. But let’s face it, everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.
Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. An earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks.
Company has bought back shares previously – and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so I wouldn’t put a potential stock buyback past the company.
All in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen ~15% over the last few weeks, it’s quite a surprise that the stock hasn’t rallied much more.
More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).
A question from the “Growth Bros”: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?
A common question – and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.
  But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light. So, 2 points worth noting:
1. Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is ‘reinvestment’. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
   2. Reasonably capex-light business: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.
  Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

 - R&amp;D – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and
  - Capex - including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase
 In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their ‘investment phase’, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.
So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so, why hasn’t
  the share price gone up then?
Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.
Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20’s performance) as well.
Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.
  Hedge Funds’ share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 – when performance improved dramatically.
 
 Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.
Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.
So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn’t stock kept pace?
Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.
   Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. More on valuation at the end.
The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION! Folks believe that this stock is manipulated by Market Makers (MMs) who are often option sellers on $HIMX. Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed.
With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it’s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!
Q3 Earnings
Now – let’s discuss the recent earnings
Q3’21 revenue: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)
Q3’21 gross margin: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2’21 and vs 22.3% in Q3’20 (guidance was 50.5-52%) Q3’21 EBITDA: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here! Q3’21 Levered FCF of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.
  The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.
 
 Charts for annual performance incl LTM Sep’21 and YTD Sep’21 are shown below:
 So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.
 
 GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market
 Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.
Why was the market waiting on guidance? Because indications were that:
(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,
(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline) (c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)
 Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure......or at least that’s what the shorts were betting on.
Before I go into $HIMX’s guidance, let’s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) – which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4
+
its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:
 - Q4’21 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and
  - Q4’21 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.
 This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) – so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.
But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:
 - Q4 revenue would INCREASE by +4% to +8% q-o-q,
  - Gross margin: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)
  - Q4 IFRS EPS (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs
 prior year (Q4’20) of $0.195 → i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!
  - Q4 non IFRS EPS (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)
 Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!
To be fair, the margin decrease is more of a dilutionary effect than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.
“It’s simple math”, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX’s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.
 
 However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact.
But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through. In other words – earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.
This level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)
Mr. Lopez’s question is below:
 The answer to this question was pretty much that
a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 – FY19), and
   b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’.
  Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “again and
 again and again” (yes, 3 again’s specifically mentioned) – and notes that guidance this time is no different.
In fact, if you look at $HIMX’s historical guidance, you will see that the company has consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1’17) – and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.
 
 So yes – as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this “again and again and again”!!! Let’s just say management is highly credible.
Top line guidance by segment:
- Large DDIC – to GROW by high single digit q-o-q helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.
- Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC (overall) – GROW low teens q-o-q and &gt;50% yoy By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:
   - Smartphones -&gt; GROW high teens q-o-q &amp; &gt;30% yoy
 - Tablet -&gt; flat q-o-q, and
   - Automotive -&gt; GROW double-digit q-o-q and &gt;100% yoy. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX’s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.
 Interestingly within the Smartphone segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features”.
Also, and more importantly “successful engagements with some key customers have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches”. i.e. winning more market share.
Lots to like here.
Automotive is $HIMX’s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share. Company notes that the “increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle
is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle”.
Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need
 to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.
 
 As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC segment, which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.
This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application (industrial application, from what I gather) – which is on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures).
 In addition, $HIMX also notes that the number of awarded projects in this segment is growing rapidly, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical...”to name a few”. Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.
$HIMX also notes “within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company’s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from cloud service providers who look for secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services”. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.
$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year. This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future.
 
 VALUATION &amp; Conclusion
The chart below compares Himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.
However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers – with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.
The average fair value on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 – representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.
  As for transaction comps, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents 21x EV/EBITDA – which if applied to $HIMX, gives a FV of $54/share or +370% upside!
Is $54/share possible here? Absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a few steps ahead of competition with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its
 existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.
We haven’t even discussed $HIMX’s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long- term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).
But I’d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game”, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.
Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary – although, that is probably some time away.
For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.

Himax Trade Idea - Script (Images missing)
7th November 2021
Welcome to the Yield Fanatic’s Trade Idea series. This write up is on the Taiwanese
semiconductor business, Himax. The shares are listed on NASDAQ and the ticker is $HIMX.
The date of write up is 7th November 2021 – as I write this, $HIMX’s current share price is $11.45 and market cap is roughly $2.0 billion. Note that this isn’t part of the deep dive series like I mostly present but rather a unique tactical trade idea given where this company trades at the moment.
But as always, before we start, the disclaimer. A few points worth noting:
Firstly, this is not investment advice nor is it a recommendation to buy or sell any security. This is just the Yield Fanatic’s opinion of the stock in question. If you wish to seek advice, please do so from an accredited financial advisor, which the Yield Fanatic is not.
Secondly, the opinion shown in this presentation is based on Yield’s read of things. Your view may be different based on your read of things, but it is the difference in views and opinion that makes a market.
The aim of this write up and recording is to give you an unbiased VIEW of the opportunity in question. The aim is to give you all the data that you need to make your own decision.
And finally, the Yield Fanatic does have a position in Himax at present and so, the opinions expressed here may be biased. This is a name that I have traded in the past and which I will continually trade in and out of.
To be clear, the Yield Fanatic does reserve to trade or invest in the name, subject to views and valuation at that specific point in time.
   Finally and before we start, note that this was originally written up for the purpose of posting on Reddit, so the tone may seem different to the one normally adopted on my other pieces of work.
 $HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present. TLDR:
 1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company – trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!
 The shares are cheap in a more “normal” S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as stupid cheap with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation
 2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.
3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4’21 and even Q1’22, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have consistently delivered

 results “to guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether.
 4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year – representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.
 5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.
  ..and now for the fun bit:
 6. Potential for a significant short squeeze. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were ~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to ~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.
 The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short – and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “GME X’mas special”.
7. Cant confirm this (unconfirmed hearsay) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up..... and it has already shot up ~15% last couple of weeks.
  Disclosure: I own stock + Jan’22 and Mar’22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan’22 and $10 Mar’22).
 
 What does $HIMX do? Products?
 Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here’s a quick snippet of what Himax does:
$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make ‘panels’ which are, in turn, used in:
 - Large sized DDICs -&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc
 - Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs -&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc
   In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:
- High end Timing Controller which improves power efficiency in displays
   - WiseEye ultra power AI --&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ AI and ML to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet
 of Things (IoT) area.
 
  - Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays – with usage in AR/VR glasses, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), Holographic Displays, etc.
 
- Other products in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)
  As a summary – the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:
 
Revenue by segment:
Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) – with Automotive OEM representing ~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs ~12.5%.
  However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.
The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.
  
 Competitors and Market Shares:
In the Q3’21 presentation (available here), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).
You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.
As for market share by the individual segments, as of Q3’21, $HIMX’s market shares were:
   - Large DDIC: 10.5%
  - Smartphones: 10.4%
 - Tablets: 37.7% but note that $HIMX has &gt; 60% market share of Android / non iOS tablets – the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.
   - Automotive OEM: 32.8%
  So, what has been happening recently with Himax?
2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.
Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products.
 
 $HIMX management foresaw that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes”, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.
When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially.... and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.
Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX
 found itself in a very sweet spot.
This gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked. When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players), $HIMX walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!
This allowed it to take a decent amount of market share over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.
So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?
$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) .....but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like Internet of Things (IoT) and Automotive/vehicles.
In addition, the modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV) would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.
   
 On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such 5G and high performance computing (HPC) – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its DDIC business used.
In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for, some time ago.
I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.
Isn’t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?
As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 – this is from a combination of
  more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.
However, $HIMX was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand.... and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.
$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.
So yes, for now – the demand will persist, and as management has said, this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage.
Now, that’s the background. Supply secured along with said demand.
SHORT SQUEEZE
Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear Short Squeeze candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 – and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the “GME X’mas special”.
So, why do I mention a ‘SHORT SQUEEZE’ – well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest
  is around 24.7m shares, representing ~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting ~11 days to cover.
However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.
Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of “short availability utilization”. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “GME X’mas special”.
 
 With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.
 https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) – so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.
  
 As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun’21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.
The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs.
I understand the short-thesis – I really do.
Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.
The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent
guidance seems to suggest otherwise.
I can personally find NO REASON to be short this stock anymore at least for the next 7 months, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4’21 and decent outlook for Q1’22) and then we will have a dividend payment in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).
From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.
The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.
But now, its time for a reversal.
   
 The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)
$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul’21).
The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been ~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.
So far, YTD Q3’21, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.
  An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!
That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.
The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July – so we have some time. But let’s face it, everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.
Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. An earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks.
Company has bought back shares previously – and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so I wouldn’t put a potential stock buyback past the company.
All in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen ~15% over the last few weeks, it’s quite a surprise that the stock hasn’t rallied much more.
More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).
A question from the “Growth Bros”: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?
A common question – and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.
  But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light. So, 2 points worth noting:
1. Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is ‘reinvestment’. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
   2. Reasonably capex-light business: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.
  Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

 - R&amp;D – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and
  - Capex - including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase
 In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their ‘investment phase’, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.
So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so, why hasn’t
  the share price gone up then?
Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.
Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20’s performance) as well.
Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.
  Hedge Funds’ share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 – when performance improved dramatically.
 
 Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.
Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.
So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn’t stock kept pace?
Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.
   Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. More on valuation at the end.
The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION! Folks believe that this stock is manipulated by Market Makers (MMs) who are often option sellers on $HIMX. Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed.
With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it’s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!
Q3 Earnings
Now – let’s discuss the recent earnings
Q3’21 revenue: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)
Q3’21 gross margin: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2’21 and vs 22.3% in Q3’20 (guidance was 50.5-52%) Q3’21 EBITDA: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here! Q3’21 Levered FCF of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.
  The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.
 
 Charts for annual performance incl LTM Sep’21 and YTD Sep’21 are shown below:
 So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.
 
 GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market
 Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.
Why was the market waiting on guidance? Because indications were that:
(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,
(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline) (c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)
 Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure......or at least that’s what the shorts were betting on.
Before I go into $HIMX’s guidance, let’s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) – which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4
+
its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:
 - Q4’21 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and
  - Q4’21 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.
 This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) – so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.
But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:
 - Q4 revenue would INCREASE by +4% to +8% q-o-q,
  - Gross margin: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)
  - Q4 IFRS EPS (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs
 prior year (Q4’20) of $0.195 → i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!
  - Q4 non IFRS EPS (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)
 Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!
To be fair, the margin decrease is more of a dilutionary effect than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.
“It’s simple math”, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX’s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.
 
 However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact.
But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through. In other words – earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.
This level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)
Mr. Lopez’s question is below:
 The answer to this question was pretty much that
a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 – FY19), and
   b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’.
  Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “again and
 again and again” (yes, 3 again’s specifically mentioned) – and notes that guidance this time is no different.
In fact, if you look at $HIMX’s historical guidance, you will see that the company has consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1’17) – and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.
 
 So yes – as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this “again and again and again”!!! Let’s just say management is highly credible.
Top line guidance by segment:
- Large DDIC – to GROW by high single digit q-o-q helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.
- Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC (overall) – GROW low teens q-o-q and &gt;50% yoy By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:
   - Smartphones -&gt; GROW high teens q-o-q &amp; &gt;30% yoy
 - Tablet -&gt; flat q-o-q, and
   - Automotive -&gt; GROW double-digit q-o-q and &gt;100% yoy. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX’s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.
 Interestingly within the Smartphone segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features”.
Also, and more importantly “successful engagements with some key customers have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches”. i.e. winning more market share.
Lots to like here.
Automotive is $HIMX’s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share. Company notes that the “increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle
is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle”.
Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need
 to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.
 
 As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC segment, which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.
This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application (industrial application, from what I gather) – which is on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures).
 In addition, $HIMX also notes that the number of awarded projects in this segment is growing rapidly, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical...”to name a few”. Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.
$HIMX also notes “within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company’s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from cloud service providers who look for secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services”. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.
$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year. This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future.
 
 VALUATION &amp; Conclusion
The chart below compares Himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.
However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers – with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.
The average fair value on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 – representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.
  As for transaction comps, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents 21x EV/EBITDA – which if applied to $HIMX, gives a FV of $54/share or +370% upside!
Is $54/share possible here? Absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a few steps ahead of competition with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its
 existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.
We haven’t even discussed $HIMX’s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long- term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).
But I’d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game”, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.
Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary – although, that is probably some time away.
For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.

An payout mean dividend share represents dividend yield given share price today That dear friend crazy cost short The dividend usually declared June paid July time But let face everyone math long institution jump band wagon Now course assuming fund distributed dividend An earlier distribution also likely potentially share buyback Company bought back share previously honest share look ridiculously cheap given performance I put potential stock buyback past company All significant upward pressure price although share already risen last week quite surprise stock rallied much More valuation later end write A question Growth Bros paying dividend mean business grow A common question I get Not many dividend paying business grow like HIMX Understandable But note HIMX DDIC peer fable design house meaning capex light So point worth noting Dividend based EPS net R amp D expense gt reinvestment R amp D spent new product innovation upgrade mostly Reasonably capex light business HIMX fable involve significant amount capex Also HIMX invested significantly R amp D capex FY FY given expectation potential surge demand product Specifically focussed developing new product line upgrading existing product R amp D including spend upgrade existing product line move towards higher quality product range like product K K TVs well focus developing new product non DDIC business Capex including payment secure additional foundry capacity well expansion existing production capability existing product including land purchase In word year pain FY FY effectively investment phase HIMX shareholder enjoying fruit hard earned labour today So performance great massive shareholder distribution coming share price gone Well question still haunt longs name Performance valuation side company reinstated dividend FY performance well Perhaps answer stock predominantly owned traded retail investor However changing hedge fund institution getting involved The chart show change time Hedge Funds share increased outstanding stock today institutional incl mutual fund ownership increased FY today Note much increase came FY FY performance improved dramatically Much attributed company actively marketing attending conference pitching institution The institutional HF participation set increase opinion Also note founder CEO family owns company So performance getting better institutional ownership improving stock kept pace Well firstly stock climbed significantly since jumped mere share share today The high stock th June price since declined despite performance improving Although share price increased performance much better valuation today still significantly cheaper v peer More valuation end The belief amongst longs MANIPULATION Folks believe stock manipulated Market Makers MMs often option seller HIMX Retail trade option much actively stock giving incentive MMs keep stock price depressed With performance outlook well potential stockholder distribution divi stock buyback side time TAKE BACK CONTROL Q Earnings Now let discus recent earnings Q revenue yoy q q guidance q q Q gross margin v Q v Q guidance Q EBITDA x yoy q q impact operating leverage clearly visible Q Levered FCF bringing YTD FCF The chart show quarterly performance clearly Charts annual performance incl LTM Sep YTD Sep shown So Q result came higher end guidance Excellent GUIDANCE positively surprising market Performance going decent However Q guidance market eagerly waiting short keeping close eye Why market waiting guidance Because indication consumer demand TV smartphones fading b panel maker feeling pain e HIMX customer seeing pricing decline c foundry raising price e HIMX supplier raising price Worries around cost increase fading demand would mean mix topline AND margin pressure least short betting Before I go HIMX guidance let say market following panel maker HIMX customer guiding lower volume Q nearest largest competitor Novatek released guidance Thursday th Nov morning stating Q revenue would decline q q Q gross margin would decline registered Q This Novatek guidance better market feared Novatek stock rose Taiwan waiting HIMX report something similar But HIMX KILLED IT Why It reported Q revenue would INCREASE q q Gross margin would fall around reported Q Q IFRS EPS dividend based YTD already v prior year Q e forecast grow roughly x Q non IFRS EPS adjusted non recurring item SBC v prior year Q x roughly Yes margin marginally e foundry raising price one expected growth revenue coming To fair margin decrease dilutionary effect cost increase impact HIMX passing price increase customer anyway It simple math CEO explained call He noted original foundry cost HIMX selling price gt gross margin would However foundry raised price HIMX passed customer selling price increased margin would gt dilutionary impact rather pure profitability impact But I said earlier one expected growth revenue coming In word earnings good guidance took market surprise This level surprise best encapsulated question Vertical Group analyst Jon Lopez analyst SELL rating HIMX target expectation bad Q perhaps Mr Lopez question The answer question pretty much HIMX giving lot lower end business price competition rampant return higher end HQ business get industry recognition company aggressively investing product suite upgrade FY FY b HIMX building relationship top tier brand directly rather going panel maker making demand product defensive Management also alluded proven sale performance v guidance yes specifically mentioned note guidance time different In fact look HIMX historical guidance see company consistently delivered earnings within guidance least last quarter since Q case either higher end guidance beat altogether So yes CEO Jordan Wu note company history delivering beating guidance shown Let say management highly credible Top line guidance segment Large DDIC GROW high single digit q q helped growth notebook monitor although TV sale drop slightly due softer end market However HIMX remains positive large DDIC given shortage wafer capacity Small amp Mid sized DDIC overall GROW low teen q q gt yoy By sub segment within small amp mid sized DDIC Smartphones gt GROW high teen q q amp gt yoy Tablet gt flat q q Automotive gt GROW double digit q q gt yoy Stalled capacity restricting HIMX ability meet customer demand significant shortage still persists Interestingly within Smartphone segment HIMX mkt share company note undertaking new design development supporting higher frame rate ultra slim bezel higher resolution feature Also importantly successful engagement key customer achieved Q customer indicating interest next launch e winning market share Lots like Automotive HIMX highest growth area hold growing market share Company note increase number size sophistication display inside vehicle evolving rapid rate indicating much DDIC demand per vehicle Not going write extract Q earnings tell everything need know show positive future business within segment As noted earlier HIMX also non DDIC segment expected decline Q expected significant growth contributor onwards higher margin This segment includes component AR VR amp IoT application This longer term area worth watching adoption increase last quarter HIMX reported design win top tier name mainstream application industrial application I gather track enter mass production Q result visible figure In addition HIMX also note number awarded project segment growing rapidly covering broad range application including notebook home appliance utility meter automotive battery surveillance camera panoramic video conferencing medical name Some application already slated mass production end year meaning see benefit coming HIMX also note within year since HIMX started sampling company WiseEye solution also drawn much attention cloud service provider look secure low power edge AI device help collect big data cloud based service This open new market frontier area like smart city smart office healthcare agriculture retail factory automation HIMX anticipates design win award growing volume shipment starting next year This segment drive lot growth business future VALUATION amp Conclusion The chart compare Himax valuation v peer note competitor division apart DDIC make direct comp However metric LTM basis HIMX screen much cheaper v peer minimum upside Upside using traded comparables representing fair value share v today The average fair value traded comparables HIMX share representing upside v current share price As transaction comp South Korean DDIC business Magnachip MX US currently subject takeover offer Chinese private equity Wise Road Capital share US government trying stop This offer represents x EV EBITDA applied HIMX give FV share upside Is share possible Absolutely business growing nearest competitor Novatek actually declining This business invested future step ahead competition respect developing new product well upgrading existing product suite building direct relationship end brand We even discussed HIMX potential growth AR VR even mid long term plan nothing imminent next year But I say foot door already mean remain relevant game whether game physical digital even METAVERSE Yes Metaverse beneficiary although probably time away For I rest case Good business excellent valuation potential massive short

# $HIMX - a potential Short squeeze play. GME X'mas special!

**$HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present.**

**TLDR:**

1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company – trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!

The shares are cheap in a more “normal” S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as ***stupid cheap*** with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation

2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.

3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4’21 and even Q1’22, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have ***consistently delivered results “to guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether***\*.\*

4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year – representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.

5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.

..and now for the fun bit:

6. ***Potential for a significant short squeeze***. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were \~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to \~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.

The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short – and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a **“*****GME X’mas special*****”.**

7. Cant confirm this (***unconfirmed hearsay***) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an ***Asian hedge fund*** which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up….. and it has already shot up \~15% last couple of weeks.

Disclosure: I own stock + Jan’22 and Mar’22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan’22 and $10 Mar’22).

**What does $HIMX do? Products?**

Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here’s a quick snippet of what Himax does:

$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make ‘panels’ which are, in turn, used in:

\- ***Large sized DDICs*** \-&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc

\- ***Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs*** \-&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n5x51h81m9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfd9a80bb277f6c024707280df2ac0800213e008

In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:

\- ***High end Timing Controller***  which improves power efficiency in displays

\- ***WiseEye ultra power AI*** \--&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ ***AI and ML*** to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet of Things (IoT) area.

&amp;#x200B;

\- ***Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays*** – with usage in ***AR/VR glasses***, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), ***Holographic Displays***, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**Revenue by segment:**

Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) – with Automotive OEM representing \~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs \~12.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

***However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.***

The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.

**Competitors and Market Shares:**

In the Q3’21 presentation (available [here](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21_HIMX-Investor-Presentation_FInal.pdf)), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).

You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.

As for ***market share*** by the individual segments, as of Q3’21, $HIMX’s market shares were:

\- Large DDIC: 10.5%

\- Smartphones: 10.4%

\- ***Tablets: 37.7%*** but note that ***$HIMX has &gt; 60% market share*** of Android / non iOS tablets – the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.

\- ***Automotive OEM: 32.8%***

**So, what has been happening recently with Himax?**

2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.

Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products.

$HIMX management ***foresaw*** that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes”, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.

When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially…. and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.

***Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX*** – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX found itself in a very sweet spot.

This gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked. ***When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players),*** [***$HIMX***](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;src=cashtag_click) ***walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!***

This allowed it to ***take a decent amount of market share*** over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/068apgs4m9y71.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12cdaa1ee73ce6b8c1bc1c3a041b71d5441c3155

**So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?**

$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) …..but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like ***Internet of Things (IoT)*** and ***Automotive/vehicles***.

In addition, the ***modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV)*** would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that ***this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly***. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.

On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such ***5G and high performance computing (HPC)*** – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its DDIC business used.

In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for, some time ago.

***I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.***

**Isn’t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?**

As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 – this is from a combination of more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.

However, $HIMX was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand…. and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.

$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.

So yes, for now – the demand will persist, and as management has said, ***this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage***\*.\*

Now, that’s the background\*\*.\*\* ***Supply secured along with said demand.***

**SHORT SQUEEZE**

Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear ***Short Squeeze*** candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 – and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the “***GME X’mas special***”.

So, why do I mention a ‘***SHORT SQUEEZE***\*\*’\*\* – well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest is around 24.7m shares, representing \~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting \~11 days to cover.

However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.

Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of “short availability utilization”. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “***GME X’mas special***”.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e6jl8ja5m9y71.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bca75f3bff938bac1627c1ee400d55464ca456fd

With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, ***there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.***

[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX) gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) – so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kdsze7o5m9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8508d2baf167f705145fe82387697042098998fa

As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun’21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.

The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. ***I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs.***

I understand the short-thesis – I really do.

Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.

***The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent guidance seems to suggest otherwise.***

I can personally find ***NO REASON*** to be short this stock anymore at least for the ***next 7 months***, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4’21 and decent outlook for Q1’22) and then we will have a ***dividend payment*** in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).

***From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.***

The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.

***But now, its time for a reversal.***

**The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)**

$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul’21).

The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been \~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.

So far, YTD Q3’21, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.

An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a ***dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!***

***That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.***

The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July – so we have some time. But let’s face it, everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.

Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. ***An earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks.***

Company has bought back shares previously – and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so I wouldn’t put a potential stock buyback past the company.

All in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen \~15% over the last few weeks, it’s quite a surprise that the stock hasn’t rallied much more.

More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).

**A question from the “Growth Bros”: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?**

A common question – and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.

But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light.

So, 2 points worth noting:

1. ***Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is ‘reinvestment***\*\*’\*\*. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
2. ***Reasonably capex-light business***: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.

Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

\- ***R&amp;D*** – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and

\- ***Capex*** \- including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase

In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their ‘investment phase’, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.

**So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so, why hasn’t the share price gone up then?**

Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.

Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20’s performance) as well.

Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fktzhqb6m9y71.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c89e04defb6c099bc4b9bc42ffbbb8a629c300ea

Hedge Funds’ share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 – when performance improved dramatically.

Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. ***The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.***

Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.

**So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn’t stock kept pace?**

Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.

Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. ***More on valuation at the end***\*\*.\*\*

***The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION!*** Folks believe that this stock is ***manipulated by Market Makers (MMs)*** who are often option sellers on $HIMX\*\*.\*\* ***Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed***\*\*.\*\*

**With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it’s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!**

**Q3 Earnings**

Now – let’s discuss the recent earnings

***Q3’21 revenue***: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)

***Q3’21 gross margin***: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2’21 and vs 22.3% in Q3’20 (guidance was 50.5-52%)

**Q3’21 EBITDA**: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here!

***Q3’21 Levered FCF*** of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.

The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.

***So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.***

**GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market**

Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.

***Why was the market waiting on guidance?*** Because indications were that:

(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,

(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline)

(c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)

Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure……or at least that’s what the shorts were betting on.

Before I go into $HIMX’s guidance, let’s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) – which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4

\+

its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:

\- Q4’21 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and

\- Q4’21 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.

This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) – so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.

***But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:***

\- ***Q4 revenue*** would ***INCREASE*** by +4% to +8% q-o-q,

\- ***Gross margin***: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)

\- ***Q4 IFRS EPS*** (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.195 i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!

\- ***Q4 non IFRS EPS*** (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)

Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) ***but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!***

To be fair, the ***margin increase is more of a dilutionary effect*** than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.

“It’s simple math”, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX’s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.

However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; ***a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact***\*.\*

***But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through.*** In other words – earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.

This level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)

Mr. Lopez’s question is below:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1u3gy7v7m9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d297a98c6bf56b94befc9944e71213700183033

The answer to this question was pretty much that

a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (*the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 – FY19*), and

b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’.

Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “***again and again and again***” (yes, 3 again’s specifically mentioned) – and notes that guidance this time is no different.

In fact, if you look at $HIMX’s historical guidance, you will see that the company has ***consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1’17) – and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.***

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p91sf7e8m9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d80df51e444182c244f0223e67d9318508036043

So yes – as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this “again and again and again”!!! Let’s just say ***management is highly credible.***

**Top line guidance by segment:**

\- ***Large DDIC*** – to ***GROW*** by ***high single digit q-o-q*** helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.

\- ***Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC*** (overall) – ***GROW*** ***low teens q-o-q*** and ***&gt;50% yoy***

By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:

\- ***Smartphones*** \-&gt; ***GROW*** ***high teens q-o-q*** &amp; ***&gt;30% yoy***

\- ***Tablet*** \-&gt; flat q-o-q, and

\- ***Automotive*** \-&gt; ***GROW*** ***double-digit q-o-q*** and ***&gt;100% yoy***. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX’s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.

Interestingly within the ***Smartphone*** segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features”.

Also, and more importantly ***“successful engagements with some key customers*** have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches”. i.e. ***winning more market share.***

***Lots to like here.***

***Automotive*** is $HIMX’s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share.

Company notes that the “increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle”.

Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/alw2qvp8m9y71.png?width=575&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5186906e4e3721c278f3ada2060c45e75545f7ee

As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a ***non-DDIC segment***\*,\* which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for ***AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.***

This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a ***design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application*** (industrial application, from what I gather) – which is ***on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures)****.*

In addition, $HIMX also notes that the ***number of awarded projects*** in this segment is ***growing rapidly***, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical…”to name a few”. ***Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.***

$HIMX also notes “within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company’s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from ***cloud service providers*** who look for ***secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services***”. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like ***smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.***

$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year.

***This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future***\*.\*

**VALUATION &amp; Conclusion**

The chart below compares Himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.

However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers – with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.

The ***average fair value*** on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 – representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vz827099m9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e5562ad7509cb6c31d88c1def5e4a05dcdd6bda

As for ***transaction comps***, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents ***21x EV/EBITDA*** – which if applied to $HIMX, gives a ***FV of $54/share + 370% upside***\*!\*

***Is $54/share possible here?*** Absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a ***few steps ahead of competition*** with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.

We haven’t even discussed $HIMX’s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long-term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).

***But I’d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game”, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.***

***Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary*** – although, that is probably some time away.

For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.

**Let’s squeeze this one dry. GME X’mas special.**

# $HIMX - a potential Short squeeze play. GME X'mas special!

**$HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present.**

**TLDR:**

1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company – trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!

The shares are cheap in a more “normal” S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as ***stupid cheap*** with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation

2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.

3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4’21 and even Q1’22, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have ***consistently delivered results “to guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether***\*.\*

4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year – representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.

5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.

..and now for the fun bit:

6. ***Potential for a significant short squeeze***. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were \~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to \~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.

The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short – and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a **“*****GME X’mas special*****”.**

7. Cant confirm this (***unconfirmed hearsay***) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an ***Asian hedge fund*** which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up….. and it has already shot up \~15% last couple of weeks.

Disclosure: I own stock + Jan’22 and Mar’22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan’22 and $10 Mar’22).

**What does $HIMX do? Products?**

Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here’s a quick snippet of what Himax does:

$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make ‘panels’ which are, in turn, used in:

\- ***Large sized DDICs*** \-&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc

\- ***Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs*** \-&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n5x51h81m9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfd9a80bb277f6c024707280df2ac0800213e008

In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:

\- ***High end Timing Controller***  which improves power efficiency in displays

\- ***WiseEye ultra power AI*** \--&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ ***AI and ML*** to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet of Things (IoT) area.

**Revenue by segment:**

Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) – with Automotive OEM representing \~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs \~12.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k9wfeaf3m9y71.png?width=482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=075f8b8ecc9a7141c63f9854c4ef547874978c67

***However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.***

The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.

**Competitors and Market Shares:**

In the Q3’21 presentation (available [here](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21_HIMX-Investor-Presentation_FInal.pdf)), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).

You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.

&amp;#x200B;

As for ***market share*** by the individual segments, as of Q3’21, $HIMX’s market shares were:

\- Large DDIC: 10.5%

\- Smartphones: 10.4%

\- ***Tablets: 37.7%*** but note that ***$HIMX has &gt; 60% market share*** of Android / non iOS tablets – the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.

\- ***Automotive OEM: 32.8%***

**So, what has been happening recently with Himax?**

2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.

Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products.

$HIMX management ***foresaw*** that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes”, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.

When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially…. and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.

***Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX*** – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX found itself in a very sweet spot.

This gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked. ***When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players),*** [***$HIMX***](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;src=cashtag_click) ***walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!***

This allowed it to ***take a decent amount of market share*** over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/068apgs4m9y71.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12cdaa1ee73ce6b8c1bc1c3a041b71d5441c3155

**So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?**

$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) …..but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like ***Internet of Things (IoT)*** and ***Automotive/vehicles***.

In addition, the ***modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV)*** would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that ***this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly***. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.

On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such ***5G and high performance computing (HPC)*** – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its DDIC business used.

In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for, some time ago.

***I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.***

**Isn’t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?**

As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 – this is from a combination of more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.

However, $HIMX was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand…. and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.

$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.

So yes, for now – the demand will persist, and as management has said, ***this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage***\*.\*

Now, that’s the background\*\*.\*\* ***Supply secured along with said demand.***

**SHORT SQUEEZE**

Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear ***Short Squeeze*** candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 – and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the “***GME X’mas special***”.

So, why do I mention a ‘***SHORT SQUEEZE***\*\*’\*\* – well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest is around 24.7m shares, representing \~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting \~11 days to cover.

However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.

Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of “short availability utilization”. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “***GME X’mas special***”.

With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, ***there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.***

[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX) gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) – so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kdsze7o5m9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8508d2baf167f705145fe82387697042098998fa

As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun’21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.

The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. ***I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs.***

I understand the short-thesis – I really do.

Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.

***The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent guidance seems to suggest otherwise.***

I can personally find ***NO REASON*** to be short this stock anymore at least for the ***next 7 months***, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4’21 and decent outlook for Q1’22) and then we will have a ***dividend payment*** in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).

***From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.***

The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.

***But now, its time for a reversal.***

**The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)**

$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul’21).

The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been \~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.

So far, YTD Q3’21, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.

An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a ***dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!***

***That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.***

The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July – so we have some time. But let’s face it, everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.

Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. ***An earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks.***

Company has bought back shares previously – and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so I wouldn’t put a potential stock buyback past the company.

All in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen \~15% over the last few weeks, it’s quite a surprise that the stock hasn’t rallied much more.

More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).

**A question from the “Growth Bros”: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?**

A common question – and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.

But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light.

So, 2 points worth noting:

1. ***Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is ‘reinvestment***\*\*’\*\*. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
2. ***Reasonably capex-light business***: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.

Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

\- ***R&amp;D*** – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and

\- ***Capex*** \- including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase

In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their ‘investment phase’, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.

**So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so, why hasn’t the share price gone up then?**

Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.

Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20’s performance) as well.

Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fktzhqb6m9y71.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c89e04defb6c099bc4b9bc42ffbbb8a629c300ea

Hedge Funds’ share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 – when performance improved dramatically.

Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. ***The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.***

Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.

**So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn’t stock kept pace?**

Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.

Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. ***More on valuation at the end***\*\*.\*\*

***The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION!*** Folks believe that this stock is ***manipulated by Market Makers (MMs)*** who are often option sellers on $HIMX\*\*.\*\* ***Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed***\*\*.\*\*

**With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it’s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!**

**Q3 Earnings**

Now – let’s discuss the recent earnings

***Q3’21 revenue***: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)

***Q3’21 gross margin***: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2’21 and vs 22.3% in Q3’20 (guidance was 50.5-52%)

**Q3’21 EBITDA**: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here!

***Q3’21 Levered FCF*** of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.

The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.

***So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.***

**GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market**

Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.

***Why was the market waiting on guidance?*** Because indications were that:

(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,

(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline)

(c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)

Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure……or at least that’s what the shorts were betting on.

Before I go into $HIMX’s guidance, let’s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) – which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4

\+

its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:

\- Q4’21 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and

\- Q4’21 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.

This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) – so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.

***But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:***

\- ***Q4 revenue*** would ***INCREASE*** by +4% to +8% q-o-q,

\- ***Gross margin***: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)

\- ***Q4 IFRS EPS*** (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.195 i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!

\- ***Q4 non IFRS EPS*** (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)

Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) ***but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!***

To be fair, the ***margin increase is more of a dilutionary effect*** than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.

“It’s simple math”, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX’s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.

However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; ***a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact***\*.\*

***But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through.*** In other words – earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.

This level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)

Mr. Lopez’s question is below:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1u3gy7v7m9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d297a98c6bf56b94befc9944e71213700183033

The answer to this question was pretty much that

a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (*the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 – FY19*), and

b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’.

Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “***again and again and again***” (yes, 3 again’s specifically mentioned) – and notes that guidance this time is no different.

In fact, if you look at $HIMX’s historical guidance, you will see that the company has ***consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1’17) – and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.***

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p91sf7e8m9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d80df51e444182c244f0223e67d9318508036043

So yes – as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this “again and again and again”!!! Let’s just say ***management is highly credible.***

**Top line guidance by segment:**

\- ***Large DDIC*** – to ***GROW*** by ***high single digit q-o-q*** helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.

\- ***Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC*** (overall) – ***GROW*** ***low teens q-o-q*** and ***&gt;50% yoy***

By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:

\- ***Smartphones*** \-&gt; ***GROW*** ***high teens q-o-q*** &amp; ***&gt;30% yoy***

\- ***Tablet*** \-&gt; flat q-o-q, and

\- ***Automotive*** \-&gt; ***GROW*** ***double-digit q-o-q*** and ***&gt;100% yoy***. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX’s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.

Interestingly within the ***Smartphone*** segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features”.

Also, and more importantly ***“successful engagements with some key customers*** have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches”. i.e. ***winning more market share.***

***Lots to like here.***

***Automotive*** is $HIMX’s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share.

Company notes that the “increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle”.

Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/alw2qvp8m9y71.png?width=575&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5186906e4e3721c278f3ada2060c45e75545f7ee

As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a ***non-DDIC segment***\*,\* which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for ***AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.***

This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a ***design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application*** (industrial application, from what I gather) – which is ***on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures)****.*

In addition, $HIMX also notes that the ***number of awarded projects*** in this segment is ***growing rapidly***, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical…”to name a few”. ***Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.***

$HIMX also notes “within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company’s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from ***cloud service providers*** who look for ***secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services***”. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like ***smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.***

$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year.

***This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future***\*.\*

**VALUATION &amp; Conclusion**

The chart below compares Himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.

However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers – with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.

The ***average fair value*** on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 – representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vz827099m9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e5562ad7509cb6c31d88c1def5e4a05dcdd6bda

As for ***transaction comps***, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents ***21x EV/EBITDA*** – which if applied to $HIMX, gives a ***FV of $54/share + 370% upside***\*!\*

***Is $54/share possible here?*** Absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a ***few steps ahead of competition*** with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.

We haven’t even discussed $HIMX’s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long-term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).

***But I’d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game”, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.***

***Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary*** – although, that is probably some time away.

For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.

upgrade FY FY b HIMX building relationship top tier brand directly rather going panel maker making demand product defensive Management also alluded proven sale performance v guidance yes specifically mentioned note guidance time different In fact look HIMX historical guidance see company consistently delivered earnings within guidance least last quarter since Q case either higher end guidance beat altogether amp x B So yes CEO Jordan Wu note company history delivering beating guidance shown Let say management highly credible Top line guidance segment Large DDIC GROW high single digit q q helped growth notebook monitor although TV sale drop slightly due softer end market However HIMX remains positive large DDIC given shortage wafer capacity Small amp Mid sized DDIC overall GROW low teen q q gt yoy By sub segment within small amp mid sized DDIC Smartphones gt GROW high teen q q amp gt yoy Tablet gt flat q q Automotive gt GROW double digit q q gt yoy Stalled capacity restricting HIMX ability meet customer demand significant shortage still persists Interestingly within Smartphone segment HIMX mkt share company note undertaking new design development supporting higher frame rate ultra slim bezel higher resolution feature Also importantly successful engagement key customer achieved Q customer indicating interest next launch e winning market share Lots like Automotive HIMX highest growth area hold growing market share Company note increase number size sophistication display inside vehicle evolving rapid rate indicating much DDIC demand per vehicle Not going write

**$HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present.**

**TLDR:**

1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company – trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!

The shares are cheap in a more “normal” S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as ***stupid cheap*** with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation

2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.

3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4’21 and even Q1’22, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have ***consistently delivered results “to guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether***\*.\*

4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year – representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.

5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.

..and now for the fun bit:

6. ***Potential for a significant short squeeze***. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were \~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to \~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.

The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short – and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a **“*****GME X’mas special*****”.**

7. Cant confirm this (***unconfirmed hearsay***) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an ***Asian hedge fund*** which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up….. and it has already shot up \~15% last couple of weeks.

Disclosure: I own stock + Jan’22 and Mar’22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan’22 and $10 Mar’22).

**What does $HIMX do? Products?**

Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here’s a quick snippet of what Himax does:

$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make ‘panels’ which are, in turn, used in:

\- ***Large sized DDICs*** \-&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc

\- ***Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs*** \-&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h50s60ugk9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=892a3056cf01889198bc457d8f82f6b8b400bfda

In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:

\- ***High end Timing Controller (TCON)*** which improves power efficiency in displays

\- ***WiseEye ultra power AI*** \--&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ ***AI and ML*** to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet of Things (IoT) area.

&amp;#x200B;

\- ***Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays*** – with usage in ***AR/VR glasses***, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), ***Holographic Displays***, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

As a summary – the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:

**Revenue by segment:**

Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) – with Automotive OEM representing \~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs \~12.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iurexiwjk9y71.png?width=482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7815ba65eeac79d794ecfbb85ff070c59100a38d

***However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.***

The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.

**Competitors and Market Shares:**

In the Q3’21 presentation (available [here](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21_HIMX-Investor-Presentation_FInal.pdf)), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).

You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.

As for ***market share*** by the individual segments, as of Q3’21, $HIMX’s market shares were:

\- Large DDIC: 10.5%

\- Smartphones: 10.4%

\- ***Tablets: 37.7%*** but note that ***$HIMX has &gt; 60% market share*** of Android / non iOS tablets – the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.

\- ***Automotive OEM: 32.8%***

**So, what has been happening recently with Himax?**

2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.

Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products.

$HIMX management ***foresaw*** that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes”, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.

When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially…. and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.

***Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX*** – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX found itself in a very sweet spot.

This gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked. ***When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players),*** [***$HIMX***](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;src=cashtag_click) ***walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!***

This allowed it to ***take a decent amount of market share*** over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/phfpsc7lk9y71.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=105a9a81f695b40972159284b71221332b135fa3

**So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?**

$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) …..but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like ***Internet of Things (IoT)*** and ***Automotive/vehicles***.

In addition, the ***modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV)*** would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that ***this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly***. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.

On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such ***5G and high performance computing (HPC)*** – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its DDIC business used.

In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for, some time ago.

***I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.***

**Isn’t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?**

As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 – this is from a combination of more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.

However, $HIMX was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand…. and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.

$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.

So yes, for now – the demand will persist, and as management has said, ***this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage***\*.\*

Now, that’s the background\*\*.\*\* ***Supply secured along with said demand.***

**SHORT SQUEEZE**

Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear ***Short Squeeze*** candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 – and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the “***GME X’mas special***”.

So, why do I mention a ‘***SHORT SQUEEZE***\*\*’\*\* – well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest is around 24.7m shares, representing \~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting \~11 days to cover.

However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.

Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of “short availability utilization”. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “***GME X’mas special***”.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wlec4jnlk9y71.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7431b6338296b82f9ee58f4cd68efcf085006046

With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, ***there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.***

[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX) gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) – so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8gur681mk9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c19567105edc88b46b8a5ecb1fb38f267d2f1a08

As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun’21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.

The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. ***I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs.***

I understand the short-thesis – I really do.

Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.

***The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent guidance seems to suggest otherwise.***

I can personally find ***NO REASON*** to be short this stock anymore at least for the ***next 7 months***, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4’21 and decent outlook for Q1’22) and then we will have a ***dividend payment*** in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).

***From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.***

The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.

***But now, its time for a reversal.***

**The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)**

$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul’21).

The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been \~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.

So far, YTD Q3’21, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.

An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a ***dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!***

***That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.***

The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July – so we have some time. But let’s face it, everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.

Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. ***An earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks.***

Company has bought back shares previously – and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so I wouldn’t put a potential stock buyback past the company.

All in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen \~15% over the last few weeks, it’s quite a surprise that the stock hasn’t rallied much more.

More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).

**A question from the “Growth Bros”: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?**

A common question – and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.

But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light.

So, 2 points worth noting:

1. ***Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is ‘reinvestment***\*\*’\*\*. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
2. ***Reasonably capex-light business***: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.

Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

\- ***R&amp;D*** – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and

\- ***Capex*** \- including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase

In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their ‘investment phase’, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.

**So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so, why hasn’t the share price gone up then?**

Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.

Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20’s performance) as well.

Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fmymorlmk9y71.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=263b1739f6cc3a650e588fdfc56d4b6738627e1c

Hedge Funds’ share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 – when performance improved dramatically.

Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. ***The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.***

Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.

**So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn’t stock kept pace?**

Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.

Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. ***More on valuation at the end***\*\*.\*\*

***The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION!*** Folks believe that this stock is ***manipulated by Market Makers (MMs)*** who are often option sellers on $HIMX\*\*.\*\* ***Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed***\*\*.\*\*

**With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it’s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!**

**Q3 Earnings**

Now – let’s discuss the recent earnings

***Q3’21 revenue***: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)

***Q3’21 gross margin***: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2’21 and vs 22.3% in Q3’20 (guidance was 50.5-52%)

**Q3’21 EBITDA**: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here!

***Q3’21 Levered FCF*** of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.

The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.

***So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.***

**GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market**

Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.

***Why was the market waiting on guidance?*** Because indications were that:

(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,

(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline)

(c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)

Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure……or at least that’s what the shorts were betting on.

Before I go into $HIMX’s guidance, let’s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) – which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4

\+

its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:

\- Q4’21 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and

\- Q4’21 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.

This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) – so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.

***But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:***

\- ***Q4 revenue*** would ***INCREASE*** by +4% to +8% q-o-q,

\- ***Gross margin***: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)

\- ***Q4 IFRS EPS*** (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.195 i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!

\- ***Q4 non IFRS EPS*** (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)

Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) ***but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!***

To be fair, the ***margin increase is more of a dilutionary effect*** than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.

“It’s simple math”, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX’s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.

However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; ***a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact***\*.\*

***But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through.*** In other words – earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.

This level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)

Mr. Lopez’s question is below:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7o5zrc2ok9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70ace07de87afe215430326d27d1167ffd4c658c

The answer to this question was pretty much that

a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (*the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 – FY19*), and

b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’.

Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “***again and again and again***” (yes, 3 again’s specifically mentioned) – and notes that guidance this time is no different.

In fact, if you look at $HIMX’s historical guidance, you will see that the company has ***consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1’17) – and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.***

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s0yjfpkok9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a10edbd9f81926ce7deae84be3ff51cda607343

So yes – as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this “again and again and again”!!! Let’s just say ***management is highly credible.***

**Top line guidance by segment:**

\- ***Large DDIC*** – to ***GROW*** by ***high single digit q-o-q*** helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.

\- ***Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC*** (overall) – ***GROW*** ***low teens q-o-q*** and ***&gt;50% yoy***

By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:

\- ***Smartphones*** \-&gt; ***GROW*** ***high teens q-o-q*** &amp; ***&gt;30% yoy***

\- ***Tablet*** \-&gt; flat q-o-q, and

\- ***Automotive*** \-&gt; ***GROW*** ***double-digit q-o-q*** and ***&gt;100% yoy***. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX’s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.

Interestingly within the ***Smartphone*** segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features”.

Also, and more importantly ***“successful engagements with some key customers*** have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches”. i.e. ***winning more market share.***

***Lots to like here.***

***Automotive*** is $HIMX’s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share.

Company notes that the “increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle”.

Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vxurb10pk9y71.png?width=575&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f96ab1778b831b523496516c34108fc13244e799

As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a ***non-DDIC segment***\*,\* which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for ***AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.***

This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a ***design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application*** (industrial application, from what I gather) – which is ***on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures)****.*

In addition, $HIMX also notes that the ***number of awarded projects*** in this segment is ***growing rapidly***, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical…”to name a few”. ***Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.***

$HIMX also notes “within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company’s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from ***cloud service providers*** who look for ***secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services***”. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like ***smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.***

$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year.

***This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future***\*.\*

**VALUATION &amp; Conclusion**

The chart below compares Himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.

However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers – with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.

The ***average fair value*** on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 – representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.

&amp;#x200B;

As for ***transaction comps***, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents ***21x EV/EBITDA*** – which if applied to $HIMX, gives a ***FV of $54/share + 370% upside***\*!\*

***Is $54/share possible here?*** Absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a ***few steps ahead of competition*** with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.

We haven’t even discussed $HIMX’s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long-term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).

***But I’d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game”, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.***

***Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary*** – although, that is probably some time away.

For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.

**Let’s squeeze this one dry. GME X’mas special.**

**$HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present.**

**TLDR:**

1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company – trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!

The shares are cheap in a more “normal” S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as ***stupid cheap*** with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation

2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.

3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4’21 and even Q1’22, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have ***consistently delivered results “to guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether***\*.\*

4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year – representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.

5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.

..and now for the fun bit:

6. ***Potential for a significant short squeeze***. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were \~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to \~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.

The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short – and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a **“*****GME X’mas special*****”.**

7. Cant confirm this (***unconfirmed hearsay***) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an ***Asian hedge fund*** which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up….. and it has already shot up \~15% last couple of weeks.

Disclosure: I own stock + Jan’22 and Mar’22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan’22 and $10 Mar’22).

**What does $HIMX do? Products?**

Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here’s a quick snippet of what Himax does:

$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make ‘panels’ which are, in turn, used in:

\- ***Large sized DDICs*** \-&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc

\- ***Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs*** \-&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h50s60ugk9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=892a3056cf01889198bc457d8f82f6b8b400bfda

In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:

\- ***High end Timing Controller (TCON)*** which improves power efficiency in displays

\- ***WiseEye ultra power AI*** \--&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ ***AI and ML*** to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet of Things (IoT) area.

**Revenue by segment:**

Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) – with Automotive OEM representing \~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs \~12.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

***However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.***

The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.

**Competitors and Market Shares:**

In the Q3’21 presentation (available [here](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21_HIMX-Investor-Presentation_FInal.pdf)), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).

You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.

As for ***market share*** by the individual segments, as of Q3’21, $HIMX’s market shares were:

\- Large DDIC: 10.5%

\- Smartphones: 10.4%

\- ***Tablets: 37.7%*** but note that ***$HIMX has &gt; 60% market share*** of Android / non iOS tablets – the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.

\- ***Automotive OEM: 32.8%***

**So, what has been happening recently with Himax?**

2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.

Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products.

$HIMX management ***foresaw*** that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes”, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.

When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially…. and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.

***Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX*** – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX found itself in a very sweet spot.

This gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked. ***When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players),*** [***$HIMX***](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;src=cashtag_click) ***walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!***

This allowed it to ***take a decent amount of market share*** over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/phfpsc7lk9y71.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=105a9a81f695b40972159284b71221332b135fa3

**So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?**

$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) …..but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like ***Internet of Things (IoT)*** and ***Automotive/vehicles***.

In addition, the ***modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV)*** would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that ***this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly***. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.

On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such ***5G and high performance computing (HPC)*** – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its DDIC business used.

In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for, some time ago.

***I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.***

**Isn’t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?**

As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 – this is from a combination of more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.

However, $HIMX was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand…. and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.

$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.

So yes, for now – the demand will persist, and as management has said, ***this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage***\*.\*

Now, that’s the background\*\*.\*\* ***Supply secured along with said demand.***

**SHORT SQUEEZE**

Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear ***Short Squeeze*** candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 – and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the “***GME X’mas special***”.

So, why do I mention a ‘***SHORT SQUEEZE***\*\*’\*\* – well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest is around 24.7m shares, representing \~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting \~11 days to cover.

However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.

Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of “short availability utilization”. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “***GME X’mas special***”.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wlec4jnlk9y71.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7431b6338296b82f9ee58f4cd68efcf085006046

With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, ***there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.***

[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX) gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) – so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8gur681mk9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c19567105edc88b46b8a5ecb1fb38f267d2f1a08

As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun’21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.

The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. ***I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs.***

I understand the short-thesis – I really do.

Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.

***The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent guidance seems to suggest otherwise.***

I can personally find ***NO REASON*** to be short this stock anymore at least for the ***next 7 months***, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4’21 and decent outlook for Q1’22) and then we will have a ***dividend payment*** in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).

***From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.***

The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.

***But now, its time for a reversal.***

**The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)**

$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul’21).

The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been \~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.

So far, YTD Q3’21, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.

An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a ***dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!***

***That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.***

The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July – so we have some time. But let’s face it, everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.

Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. ***An earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks.***

Company has bought back shares previously – and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so I wouldn’t put a potential stock buyback past the company.

All in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen \~15% over the last few weeks, it’s quite a surprise that the stock hasn’t rallied much more.

More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).

**A question from the “Growth Bros”: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?**

A common question – and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.

But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light.

So, 2 points worth noting:

1. ***Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is ‘reinvestment***\*\*’\*\*. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
2. ***Reasonably capex-light business***: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.

Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

\- ***R&amp;D*** – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and

\- ***Capex*** \- including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase

In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their ‘investment phase’, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.

**So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so, why hasn’t the share price gone up then?**

Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.

Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20’s performance) as well.

Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fmymorlmk9y71.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=263b1739f6cc3a650e588fdfc56d4b6738627e1c

Hedge Funds’ share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 – when performance improved dramatically.

Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. ***The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.***

Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.

**So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn’t stock kept pace?**

Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.

Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. ***More on valuation at the end***\*\*.\*\*

***The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION!*** Folks believe that this stock is ***manipulated by Market Makers (MMs)*** who are often option sellers on $HIMX\*\*.\*\* ***Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed***\*\*.\*\*

**With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it’s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!**

**Q3 Earnings**

Now – let’s discuss the recent earnings

***Q3’21 revenue***: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)

***Q3’21 gross margin***: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2’21 and vs 22.3% in Q3’20 (guidance was 50.5-52%)

**Q3’21 EBITDA**: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here!

***Q3’21 Levered FCF*** of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.

The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.

***So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.***

**GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market**

Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.

***Why was the market waiting on guidance?*** Because indications were that:

(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,

(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline)

(c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)

Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure……or at least that’s what the shorts were betting on.

Before I go into $HIMX’s guidance, let’s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) – which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4

\+

its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:

\- Q4’21 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and

\- Q4’21 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.

This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) – so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.

***But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:***

\- ***Q4 revenue*** would ***INCREASE*** by +4% to +8% q-o-q,

\- ***Gross margin***: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)

\- ***Q4 IFRS EPS*** (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.195 i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!

\- ***Q4 non IFRS EPS*** (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)

Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) ***but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!***

To be fair, the ***margin increase is more of a dilutionary effect*** than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.

“It’s simple math”, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX’s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.

However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; ***a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact***\*.\*

***But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through.*** In other words – earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.

This level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)

Mr. Lopez’s question is below:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7o5zrc2ok9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70ace07de87afe215430326d27d1167ffd4c658c

The answer to this question was pretty much that

a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (*the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 – FY19*), and

b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’.

Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “***again and again and again***” (yes, 3 again’s specifically mentioned) – and notes that guidance this time is no different.

In fact, if you look at $HIMX’s historical guidance, you will see that the company has ***consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1’17) – and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.***

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s0yjfpkok9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a10edbd9f81926ce7deae84be3ff51cda607343

So yes – as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this “again and again and again”!!! Let’s just say ***management is highly credible.***

**Top line guidance by segment:**

\- ***Large DDIC*** – to ***GROW*** by ***high single digit q-o-q*** helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.

\- ***Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC*** (overall) – ***GROW*** ***low teens q-o-q*** and ***&gt;50% yoy***

By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:

\- ***Smartphones*** \-&gt; ***GROW*** ***high teens q-o-q*** &amp; ***&gt;30% yoy***

\- ***Tablet*** \-&gt; flat q-o-q, and

\- ***Automotive*** \-&gt; ***GROW*** ***double-digit q-o-q*** and ***&gt;100% yoy***. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX’s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.

Interestingly within the ***Smartphone*** segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features”.

Also, and more importantly ***“successful engagements with some key customers*** have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches”. i.e. ***winning more market share.***

***Lots to like here.***

***Automotive*** is $HIMX’s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share.

Company notes that the “increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle”.

Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vxurb10pk9y71.png?width=575&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f96ab1778b831b523496516c34108fc13244e799

As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a ***non-DDIC segment***\*,\* which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for ***AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.***

This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a ***design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application*** (industrial application, from what I gather) – which is ***on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures)****.*

In addition, $HIMX also notes that the ***number of awarded projects*** in this segment is ***growing rapidly***, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical…”to name a few”. ***Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.***

$HIMX also notes “within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company’s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from ***cloud service providers*** who look for ***secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services***”. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like ***smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.***

$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year.

***This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future***\*.\*

**VALUATION &amp; Conclusion**

The chart below compares Himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.

However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers – with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.

The ***average fair value*** on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 – representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.

&amp;#x200B;

As for ***transaction comps***, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents ***21x EV/EBITDA*** – which if applied to $HIMX, gives a ***FV of $54/share + 370% upside***\*!\*

***Is $54/share possible here?*** Absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a ***few steps ahead of competition*** with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.

We haven’t even discussed $HIMX’s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long-term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).

***But I’d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game”, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.***

***Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary*** – although, that is probably some time away.

For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.

1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company – trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!

&amp;#x200B;

The shares are cheap in a more “normal” S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as \*\*\*stupid cheap\*\*\* with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation

&amp;#x200B;

2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4’21 and even Q1’22, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have \*\*\*consistently delivered results “to guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether\*\*\*\\\*.\\\*

&amp;#x200B;

4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year – representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.

&amp;#x200B;

..and now for the fun bit:

&amp;#x200B;

6. \*\*\*Potential for a significant short squeeze\*\*\*. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were \\\~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to \\\~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.

&amp;#x200B;

The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short – and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a \*\*“\*\*\*\*\*GME X’mas special\*\*\*\*\*”.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

7. Cant confirm this (\*\*\*unconfirmed hearsay\*\*\*) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an \*\*\*Asian hedge fund\*\*\* which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up….. and it has already shot up \\\~15% last couple of weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

Disclosure: I own stock + Jan’22 and Mar’22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan’22 and $10 Mar’22).

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*What does $HIMX do? Products?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here’s a quick snippet of what Himax does:

&amp;#x200B;

$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make ‘panels’ which are, in turn, used in:

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Large sized DDICs\*\*\* \\-&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs\*\*\* \\-&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*High end Timing Controller \*\*\* which improves power efficiency in displays

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*WiseEye ultra power AI\*\*\* \\--&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ \*\*\*AI and ML\*\*\* to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet of Things (IoT) area.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays\*\*\* – with usage in \*\*\*AR/VR glasses\*\*\*, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), \*\*\*Holographic Displays\*\*\*, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Other products\*\*\* in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As a summary – the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Revenue by segment:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) – with Automotive OEM representing \\\~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs \\\~12.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Competitors and Market Shares:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

In the Q3’21 presentation (available \[here\]([https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21\_HIMX-Investor-Presentation\_FInal.pdf](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21_HIMX-Investor-Presentation_FInal.pdf))), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).

&amp;#x200B;

You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As for \*\*\*market share\*\*\* by the individual segments, as of Q3’21, $HIMX’s market shares were:

&amp;#x200B;

\\- Large DDIC: 10.5%

&amp;#x200B;

\\- Smartphones: 10.4%

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Tablets: 37.7%\*\*\* but note that \*\*\*$HIMX has &gt; 60% market share\*\*\* of Android / non iOS tablets – the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Automotive OEM: 32.8%\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*So, what has been happening recently with Himax?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.

&amp;#x200B;

Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products.

&amp;#x200B;

$HIMX management \*\*\*foresaw\*\*\* that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes”, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.

&amp;#x200B;

When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially…. and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX\*\*\* – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX found itself in a very sweet spot.

&amp;#x200B;

This gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked. \*\*\*When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players),\*\*\* \[\*\*\*$HIMX\*\*\*\]([https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;src=cashtag\_click](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;src=cashtag_click)) \*\*\*walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

This allowed it to \*\*\*take a decent amount of market share\*\*\* over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) …..but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like \*\*\*Internet of Things (IoT)\*\*\* and \*\*\*Automotive/vehicles\*\*\*.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, the \*\*\*modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV)\*\*\* would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that \*\*\*this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly\*\*\*. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such \*\*\*5G and high performance computing (HPC)\*\*\* – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its DDIC business used.

&amp;#x200B;

In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for, some time ago.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Isn’t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 – this is from a combination of more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.

&amp;#x200B;

However, $HIMX was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand…. and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.

&amp;#x200B;

$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.

&amp;#x200B;

So yes, for now – the demand will persist, and as management has said, \*\*\*this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage\*\*\*\\\*.\\\*

&amp;#x200B;

Now, that’s the background\\\*\\\*.\\\*\\\* \*\*\*Supply secured along with said demand.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*SHORT SQUEEZE\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear \*\*\*Short Squeeze\*\*\* candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 – and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the “\*\*\*GME X’mas special\*\*\*”.

&amp;#x200B;

So, why do I mention a ‘\*\*\*SHORT SQUEEZE\*\*\*\\\*\\\*’\\\*\\\* – well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest is around 24.7m shares, representing \\\~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting \\\~11 days to cover.

&amp;#x200B;

However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.

&amp;#x200B;

Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of “short availability utilization”. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “\*\*\*GME X’mas special\*\*\*”.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, \*\*\*there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\[[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX)\]([https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX)) gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) – so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun’21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.

&amp;#x200B;

The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. \*\*\*I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

I understand the short-thesis – I really do.

&amp;#x200B;

Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent guidance seems to suggest otherwise.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

I can personally find \*\*\*NO REASON\*\*\* to be short this stock anymore at least for the \*\*\*next 7 months\*\*\*, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4’21 and decent outlook for Q1’22) and then we will have a \*\*\*dividend payment\*\*\* in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*But now, its time for a reversal.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul’21).

&amp;#x200B;

The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been \\\~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.

&amp;#x200B;

So far, YTD Q3’21, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.

&amp;#x200B;

An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a \*\*\*dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July – so we have some time. But let’s face it, everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. \*\*\*An earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Company has bought back shares previously – and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so I wouldn’t put a potential stock buyback past the company.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen \\\~15% over the last few weeks, it’s quite a surprise that the stock hasn’t rallied much more.

&amp;#x200B;

More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*A question from the “Growth Bros”: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

A common question – and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.

&amp;#x200B;

But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light.

&amp;#x200B;

So, 2 points worth noting:

&amp;#x200B;

1. \*\*\*Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is ‘reinvestment\*\*\*\\\*\\\*’\\\*\\\*. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.

2. \*\*\*Reasonably capex-light business\*\*\*: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*R&amp;D\*\*\* – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Capex\*\*\* \\- including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase

&amp;#x200B;

In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their ‘investment phase’, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so, why hasn’t the share price gone up then?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.

&amp;#x200B;

Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20’s performance) as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hedge Funds’ share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 – when performance improved dramatically.

&amp;#x200B;

Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. \*\*\*The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn’t stock kept pace?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.

&amp;#x200B;

Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. \*\*\*More on valuation at the end\*\*\*\\\*\\\*.\\\*\\\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION!\*\*\* Folks believe that this stock is \*\*\*manipulated by Market Makers (MMs)\*\*\* who are often option sellers on $HIMX\\\*\\\*.\\\*\\\* \*\*\*Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed\*\*\*\\\*\\\*.\\\*\\\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it’s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Q3 Earnings\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Now – let’s discuss the recent earnings

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Q3’21 revenue\*\*\*: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Q3’21 gross margin\*\*\*: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2’21 and vs 22.3% in Q3’20 (guidance was 50.5-52%)

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Q3’21 EBITDA\*\*: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here!

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Q3’21 Levered FCF\*\*\* of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.

&amp;#x200B;

The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Charts for annual performance incl LTM Sep’21 and YTD Sep’21 are shown below:

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Why was the market waiting on guidance?\*\*\* Because indications were that:

&amp;#x200B;

(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,

&amp;#x200B;

(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline)

&amp;#x200B;

(c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)

&amp;#x200B;

Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure……or at least that’s what the shorts were betting on.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I go into $HIMX’s guidance, let’s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) – which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4

&amp;#x200B;

\\+

&amp;#x200B;

its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:

&amp;#x200B;

\\- Q4’21 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and

&amp;#x200B;

\\- Q4’21 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.

&amp;#x200B;

This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) – so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Q4 revenue\*\*\* would \*\*\*INCREASE\*\*\* by +4% to +8% q-o-q,

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Gross margin\*\*\*: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Q4 IFRS EPS\*\*\* (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.195 i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Q4 non IFRS EPS\*\*\* (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) \*\*\*but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

To be fair, the \*\*\*margin increase is more of a dilutionary effect\*\*\* than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

“It’s simple math”, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX’s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.

&amp;#x200B;

However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; \*\*\*a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact\*\*\*\\\*.\\\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through.\*\*\* In other words – earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.

&amp;#x200B;

This level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)

&amp;#x200B;

Mr. Lopez’s question is below:

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The answer to this question was pretty much that

&amp;#x200B;

a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (\*the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 – FY19\*), and

&amp;#x200B;

b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’.

&amp;#x200B;

Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “\*\*\*again and again and again\*\*\*” (yes, 3 again’s specifically mentioned) – and notes that guidance this time is no different.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, if you look at $HIMX’s historical guidance, you will see that the company has \*\*\*consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1’17) – and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So yes – as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this “again and again and again”!!! Let’s just say \*\*\*management is highly credible.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Top line guidance by segment:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Large DDIC\*\*\* – to \*\*\*GROW\*\*\* by \*\*\*high single digit q-o-q\*\*\* helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC\*\*\* (overall) – \*\*\*GROW\*\*\* \*\*\*low teens q-o-q\*\*\* and \*\*\*&gt;50% yoy\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Smartphones\*\*\* \\-&gt; \*\*\*GROW\*\*\* \*\*\*high teens q-o-q\*\*\* &amp; \*\*\*&gt;30% yoy\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Tablet\*\*\* \\-&gt; flat q-o-q, and

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Automotive\*\*\* \\-&gt; \*\*\*GROW\*\*\* \*\*\*double-digit q-o-q\*\*\* and \*\*\*&gt;100% yoy\*\*\*. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX’s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.

&amp;#x200B;

Interestingly within the \*\*\*Smartphone\*\*\* segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features”.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, and more importantly \*\*\*“successful engagements with some key customers\*\*\* have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches”. i.e. \*\*\*winning more market share.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Lots to like here.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Automotive\*\*\* is $HIMX’s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share.

&amp;#x200B;

Company notes that the “increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle”.

&amp;#x200B;

Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a \*\*\*non-DDIC segment\*\*\*\\\*,\\\* which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for \*\*\*AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a \*\*\*design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application\*\*\* (industrial application, from what I gather) – which is \*\*\*on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures)\*\*\*\*.\*

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, $HIMX also notes that the \*\*\*number of awarded projects\*\*\* in this segment is \*\*\*growing rapidly\*\*\*, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical…”to name a few”. \*\*\*Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

$HIMX also notes “within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company’s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from \*\*\*cloud service providers\*\*\* who look for \*\*\*secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services\*\*\*”. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like \*\*\*smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future\*\*\*\\\*.\\\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*VALUATION &amp; Conclusion\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

The chart below compares Himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.

&amp;#x200B;

However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers – with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.

&amp;#x200B;

The \*\*\*average fair value\*\*\* on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 – representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As for \*\*\*transaction comps\*\*\*, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents \*\*\*21x EV/EBITDA\*\*\* – which if applied to $HIMX, gives a \*\*\*FV of $54/share + 370% upside\*\*\*\\\*!\\\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Is $54/share possible here?\*\*\* Absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a \*\*\*few steps ahead of competition\*\*\* with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.

&amp;#x200B;

We haven’t even discussed $HIMX’s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long-term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*But I’d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game”, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary\*\*\* – although, that is probably some time away.

&amp;#x200B;

For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Let’s squeeze this one dry. GME X’mas special.\*\*

\[\*\*[www.yieldfanatic.com](https://www.yieldfanatic.com)\*\*\]([https://www.yieldfanatic.com/](https://www.yieldfanatic.com/))",$HIMX - a huge potential play - Extensive DD inside,2,1,"$HIMX - a huge potential play - Extensive DD inside \*\*$HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*TLDR:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company – trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!

&amp;#x200B;

The shares are cheap in a more “normal” S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as \*\*\*stupid cheap\*\*\* with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation

&amp;#x200B;

2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4’21 and even Q1’22, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have \*\*\*consistently delivered results “to guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether\*\*\*\\\*.\\\*

&amp;#x200B;

4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year – representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.

&amp;#x200B;

..and now for the fun bit:

&amp;#x200B;

6. \*\*\*Potential for a significant short squeeze\*\*\*. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were \\\~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to \\\~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.

&amp;#x200B;

The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short – and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a \*\*“\*\*\*\*\*GME X’mas special\*\*\*\*\*”.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

7. Cant confirm this (\*\*\*unconfirmed hearsay\*\*\*) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an \*\*\*Asian hedge fund\*\*\* which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up….. and it has already shot up \\\~15% last couple of weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

Disclosure: I own stock + Jan’22 and Mar’22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan’22 and $10 Mar’22).

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*What does $HIMX do? Products?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here’s a quick snippet of what Himax does:

&amp;#x200B;

$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make ‘panels’ which are, in turn, used in:

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Large sized DDICs\*\*\* \\-&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs\*\*\* \\-&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*High end Timing Controller \*\*\* which improves power efficiency in displays

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*WiseEye ultra power AI\*\*\* \\--&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ \*\*\*AI and ML\*\*\* to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet of Things (IoT) area.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays\*\*\* – with usage in \*\*\*AR/VR glasses\*\*\*, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), \*\*\*Holographic Displays\*\*\*, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Other products\*\*\* in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As a summary – the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Revenue by segment:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) – with Automotive OEM representing \\\~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs \\\~12.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Competitors and Market Shares:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

In the Q3’21 presentation (available \[here\]([https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21\_HIMX-Investor-Presentation\_FInal.pdf](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21_HIMX-Investor-Presentation_FInal.pdf))), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).

&amp;#x200B;

You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As for \*\*\*market share\*\*\* by the individual segments, as of Q3’21, $HIMX’s market shares were:

&amp;#x200B;

\\- Large DDIC: 10.5%

&amp;#x200B;

\\- Smartphones: 10.4%

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Tablets: 37.7%\*\*\* but note that \*\*\*$HIMX has &gt; 60% market share\*\*\* of Android / non iOS tablets – the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Automotive OEM: 32.8%\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*So, what has been happening recently with Himax?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.

&amp;#x200B;

Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products.

&amp;#x200B;

$HIMX management \*\*\*foresaw\*\*\* that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes”, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.

&amp;#x200B;

When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially…. and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX\*\*\* – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX found itself in a very sweet spot.

&amp;#x200B;

This gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked. \*\*\*When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players),\*\*\* \[\*\*\*$HIMX\*\*\*\]([https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;src=cashtag\_click](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;src=cashtag_click)) \*\*\*walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

This allowed it to \*\*\*take a decent amount of market share\*\*\* over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) …..but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like \*\*\*Internet of Things (IoT)\*\*\* and \*\*\*Automotive/vehicles\*\*\*.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, the \*\*\*modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV)\*\*\* would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that \*\*\*this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly\*\*\*. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such \*\*\*5G and high performance computing (HPC)\*\*\* – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its DDIC business used.

&amp;#x200B;

In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for, some time ago.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Isn’t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 – this is from a combination of more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.

&amp;#x200B;

However, $HIMX was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand…. and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.

&amp;#x200B;

$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.

&amp;#x200B;

So yes, for now – the demand will persist, and as management has said, \*\*\*this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage\*\*\*\\\*.\\\*

&amp;#x200B;

Now, that’s the background\\\*\\\*.\\\*\\\* \*\*\*Supply secured along with said demand.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*SHORT SQUEEZE\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear \*\*\*Short Squeeze\*\*\* candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 – and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the “\*\*\*GME X’mas special\*\*\*”.

&amp;#x200B;

So, why do I mention a ‘\*\*\*SHORT SQUEEZE\*\*\*\\\*\\\*’\\\*\\\* – well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest is around 24.7m shares, representing \\\~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting \\\~11 days to cover.

&amp;#x200B;

However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.

&amp;#x200B;

Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of “short availability utilization”. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “\*\*\*GME X’mas special\*\*\*”.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, \*\*\*there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\[[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX)\]([https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX)) gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) – so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun’21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.

&amp;#x200B;

The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. \*\*\*I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

I understand the short-thesis – I really do.

&amp;#x200B;

Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent guidance seems to suggest otherwise.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

I can personally find \*\*\*NO REASON\*\*\* to be short this stock anymore at least for the \*\*\*next 7 months\*\*\*, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4’21 and decent outlook for Q1’22) and then we will have a \*\*\*dividend payment\*\*\* in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*But now, its time for a reversal.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul’21).

&amp;#x200B;

The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been \\\~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.

&amp;#x200B;

So far, YTD Q3’21, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.

&amp;#x200B;

An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a \*\*\*dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July – so we have some time. But let’s face it, everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. \*\*\*An earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Company has bought back shares previously – and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so I wouldn’t put a potential stock buyback past the company.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen \\\~15% over the last few weeks, it’s quite a surprise that the stock hasn’t rallied much more.

&amp;#x200B;

More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*A question from the “Growth Bros”: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

A common question – and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.

&amp;#x200B;

But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light.

&amp;#x200B;

So, 2 points worth noting:

&amp;#x200B;

1. \*\*\*Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is ‘reinvestment\*\*\*\\\*\\\*’\\\*\\\*. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.

2. \*\*\*Reasonably capex-light business\*\*\*: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*R&amp;D\*\*\* – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Capex\*\*\* \\- including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase

&amp;#x200B;

In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their ‘investment phase’, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so, why hasn’t the share price gone up then?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.

&amp;#x200B;

Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20’s performance) as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hedge Funds’ share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 – when performance improved dramatically.

&amp;#x200B;

Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. \*\*\*The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn’t stock kept pace?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.

&amp;#x200B;

Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. \*\*\*More on valuation at the end\*\*\*\\\*\\\*.\\\*\\\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION!\*\*\* Folks believe that this stock is \*\*\*manipulated by Market Makers (MMs)\*\*\* who are often option sellers on $HIMX\\\*\\\*.\\\*\\\* \*\*\*Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed\*\*\*\\\*\\\*.\\\*\\\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it’s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Q3 Earnings\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Now – let’s discuss the recent earnings

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Q3’21 revenue\*\*\*: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Q3’21 gross margin\*\*\*: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2’21 and vs 22.3% in Q3’20 (guidance was 50.5-52%)

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Q3’21 EBITDA\*\*: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here!

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Q3’21 Levered FCF\*\*\* of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.

&amp;#x200B;

The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Charts for annual performance incl LTM Sep’21 and YTD Sep’21 are shown below:

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Why was the market waiting on guidance?\*\*\* Because indications were that:

&amp;#x200B;

(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,

&amp;#x200B;

(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline)

&amp;#x200B;

(c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)

&amp;#x200B;

Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure……or at least that’s what the shorts were betting on.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I go into $HIMX’s guidance, let’s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) – which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4

&amp;#x200B;

\\+

&amp;#x200B;

its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:

&amp;#x200B;

\\- Q4’21 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and

&amp;#x200B;

\\- Q4’21 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.

&amp;#x200B;

This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) – so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Q4 revenue\*\*\* would \*\*\*INCREASE\*\*\* by +4% to +8% q-o-q,

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Gross margin\*\*\*: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Q4 IFRS EPS\*\*\* (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.195 i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Q4 non IFRS EPS\*\*\* (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) \*\*\*but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

To be fair, the \*\*\*margin increase is more of a dilutionary effect\*\*\* than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

“It’s simple math”, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX’s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.

&amp;#x200B;

However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; \*\*\*a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact\*\*\*\\\*.\\\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through.\*\*\* In other words – earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.

&amp;#x200B;

This level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)

&amp;#x200B;

Mr. Lopez’s question is below:

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The answer to this question was pretty much that

&amp;#x200B;

a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (\*the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 – FY19\*), and

&amp;#x200B;

b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’.

&amp;#x200B;

Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “\*\*\*again and again and again\*\*\*” (yes, 3 again’s specifically mentioned) – and notes that guidance this time is no different.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, if you look at $HIMX’s historical guidance, you will see that the company has \*\*\*consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1’17) – and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So yes – as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this “again and again and again”!!! Let’s just say \*\*\*management is highly credible.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Top line guidance by segment:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Large DDIC\*\*\* – to \*\*\*GROW\*\*\* by \*\*\*high single digit q-o-q\*\*\* helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC\*\*\* (overall) – \*\*\*GROW\*\*\* \*\*\*low teens q-o-q\*\*\* and \*\*\*&gt;50% yoy\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Smartphones\*\*\* \\-&gt; \*\*\*GROW\*\*\* \*\*\*high teens q-o-q\*\*\* &amp; \*\*\*&gt;30% yoy\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Tablet\*\*\* \\-&gt; flat q-o-q, and

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Automotive\*\*\* \\-&gt; \*\*\*GROW\*\*\* \*\*\*double-digit q-o-q\*\*\* and \*\*\*&gt;100% yoy\*\*\*. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX’s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.

&amp;#x200B;

Interestingly within the \*\*\*Smartphone\*\*\* segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features”.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, and more importantly \*\*\*“successful engagements with some key customers\*\*\* have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches”. i.e. \*\*\*winning more market share.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Lots to like here.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Automotive\*\*\* is $HIMX’s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share.

&amp;#x200B;

Company notes that the “increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle”.

&amp;#x200B;

Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a \*\*\*non-DDIC segment\*\*\*\\\*,\\\* which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for \*\*\*AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a \*\*\*design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application\*\*\* (industrial application, from what I gather) – which is \*\*\*on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures)\*\*\*\*.\*

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, $HIMX also notes that the \*\*\*number of awarded projects\*\*\* in this segment is \*\*\*growing rapidly\*\*\*, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical…”to name a few”. \*\*\*Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

$HIMX also notes “within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company’s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from \*\*\*cloud service providers\*\*\* who look for \*\*\*secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services\*\*\*”. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like \*\*\*smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future\*\*\*\\\*.\\\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*VALUATION &amp; Conclusion\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

The chart below compares Himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.

&amp;#x200B;

However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers – with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.

&amp;#x200B;

The \*\*\*average fair value\*\*\* on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 – representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As for \*\*\*transaction comps\*\*\*, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents \*\*\*21x EV/EBITDA\*\*\* – which if applied to $HIMX, gives a \*\*\*FV of $54/share + 370% upside\*\*\*\\\*!\\\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Is $54/share possible here?\*\*\* Absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a \*\*\*few steps ahead of competition\*\*\* with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.

&amp;#x200B;

We haven’t even discussed $HIMX’s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long-term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*But I’d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game”, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary\*\*\* – although, that is probably some time away.

&amp;#x200B;

For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Let’s squeeze this one dry. GME X’mas special.\*\*

**$HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present.**

**TLDR:**

1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company – trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!

The shares are cheap in a more “normal” S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as ***stupid cheap*** with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation

2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.

3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4’21 and even Q1’22, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have ***consistently delivered results “to guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether***\*.\*

4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year – representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.

5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.

..and now for the fun bit:

6. ***Potential for a significant short squeeze***. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were \~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to \~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.

The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short – and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a **“*****GME X’mas special*****”.**

7. Cant confirm this (***unconfirmed hearsay***) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an ***Asian hedge fund*** which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up….. and it has already shot up \~15% last couple of weeks.

Disclosure: I own stock + Jan’22 and Mar’22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan’22 and $10 Mar’22).

**What does $HIMX do? Products?**

Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here’s a quick snippet of what Himax does:

$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make ‘panels’ which are, in turn, used in:

\- ***Large sized DDICs*** \-&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc

\- ***Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs*** \-&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xauvd0foi9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f100091008d982b11365eddb2f01cd44c01162e

In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:

\- ***High end Timing Controller (TCON)*** which improves power efficiency in displays

\- ***WiseEye ultra power AI*** \--&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ ***AI and ML*** to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet of Things (IoT) area.

**Revenue by segment:**

Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) – with Automotive OEM representing \~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs \~12.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

***However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.***

The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.

**Competitors and Market Shares:**

In the Q3’21 presentation (available [here](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21_HIMX-Investor-Presentation_FInal.pdf)), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).

You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.

As for ***market share*** by the individual segments, as of Q3’21, $HIMX’s market shares were:

\- Large DDIC: 10.5%

\- Smartphones: 10.4%

\- ***Tablets: 37.7%*** but note that ***$HIMX has &gt; 60% market share*** of Android / non iOS tablets – the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.

\- ***Automotive OEM: 32.8%***

**So, what has been happening recently with Himax?**

2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.

Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products.

$HIMX management ***foresaw*** that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes”, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.

When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially…. and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.

***Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX*** – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX found itself in a very sweet spot.

This gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked. ***When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players),*** [***$HIMX***](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;src=cashtag_click) ***walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!***

This allowed it to ***take a decent amount of market share*** over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dy2osq4ti9y71.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7471bbecf7cdbbeae78af1c495e4dfc1c18cca08

**So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?**

$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) …..but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like ***Internet of Things (IoT)*** and ***Automotive/vehicles***.

In addition, the ***modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV)*** would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that ***this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly***. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.

On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such ***5G and high performance computing (HPC)*** – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its DDIC business used.

In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for, some time ago.

***I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.***

**Isn’t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?**

As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 – this is from a combination of more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.

However, $HIMX was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand…. and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.

$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.

So yes, for now – the demand will persist, and as management has said, ***this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage***\*.\*

Now, that’s the background\*\*.\*\* ***Supply secured along with said demand.***

**SHORT SQUEEZE**

Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear ***Short Squeeze*** candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 – and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the “***GME X’mas special***”.

So, why do I mention a ‘***SHORT SQUEEZE***\*\*’\*\* – well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest is around 24.7m shares, representing \~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting \~11 days to cover.

However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.

Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of “short availability utilization”. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “***GME X’mas special***”.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9f23hvtti9y71.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7dfbd7e3f672ab3504d82035e0e479551ac7b02

With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, ***there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.***

[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX) gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) – so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3idfre8ui9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d4484efc50e8d9e3660213ecfcb05b2a828fbe2

As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun’21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.

The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. ***I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs.***

I understand the short-thesis – I really do.

Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.

***The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent guidance seems to suggest otherwise.***

I can personally find ***NO REASON*** to be short this stock anymore at least for the ***next 7 months***, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4’21 and decent outlook for Q1’22) and then we will have a ***dividend payment*** in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).

***From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.***

The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.

***But now, its time for a reversal.***

**The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)**

$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul’21).

The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been \~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.

So far, YTD Q3’21, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.

An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a ***dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!***

***That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.***

The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July – so we have some time. But let’s face it, everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.

Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. ***An earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks.***

Company has bought back shares previously – and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so I wouldn’t put a potential stock buyback past the company.

All in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen \~15% over the last few weeks, it’s quite a surprise that the stock hasn’t rallied much more.

More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).

**A question from the “Growth Bros”: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?**

A common question – and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.

But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light.

So, 2 points worth noting:

1. ***Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is ‘reinvestment***\*\*’\*\*. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
2. ***Reasonably capex-light business***: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.

Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

\- ***R&amp;D*** – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and

\- ***Capex*** \- including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase

In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their ‘investment phase’, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.

**So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so, why hasn’t the share price gone up then?**

Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.

Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20’s performance) as well.

Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/06tfb03vi9y71.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ca55057da0a7bbce8c10570cbf3b69f98cac9a8

Hedge Funds’ share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 – when performance improved dramatically.

Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. ***The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.***

Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.

**So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn’t stock kept pace?**

Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.

Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. ***More on valuation at the end***\*\*.\*\*

***The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION!*** Folks believe that this stock is ***manipulated by Market Makers (MMs)*** who are often option sellers on $HIMX\*\*.\*\* ***Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed***\*\*.\*\*

**With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it’s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!**

**Q3 Earnings**

Now – let’s discuss the recent earnings

***Q3’21 revenue***: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)

***Q3’21 gross margin***: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2’21 and vs 22.3% in Q3’20 (guidance was 50.5-52%)

**Q3’21 EBITDA**: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here!

***Q3’21 Levered FCF*** of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.

The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.

***So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.***

**GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market**

Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.

***Why was the market waiting on guidance?*** Because indications were that:

(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,

(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline)

(c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)

Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure……or at least that’s what the shorts were betting on.

Before I go into $HIMX’s guidance, let’s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) – which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4

\+

its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:

\- Q4’21 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and

\- Q4’21 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.

This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) – so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.

***But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:***

\- ***Q4 revenue*** would ***INCREASE*** by +4% to +8% q-o-q,

\- ***Gross margin***: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)

\- ***Q4 IFRS EPS*** (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.195 i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!

\- ***Q4 non IFRS EPS*** (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)

Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) ***but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!***

To be fair, the ***margin increase is more of a dilutionary effect*** than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.

“It’s simple math”, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX’s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.

However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; ***a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact***\*.\*

***But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through.*** In other words – earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.

This level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)

Mr. Lopez’s question is below:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zvps6kwwi9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1b237c9ee9fb86a957c78f5298eba51ac76f8fd

The answer to this question was pretty much that

a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (*the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 – FY19*), and

b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’.

Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “***again and again and again***” (yes, 3 again’s specifically mentioned) – and notes that guidance this time is no different.

In fact, if you look at $HIMX’s historical guidance, you will see that the company has ***consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1’17) – and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.***

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/got3rshxi9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5f649c842415a00feebddadb2d9d725450fc5f8

So yes – as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this “again and again and again”!!! Let’s just say ***management is highly credible.***

**Top line guidance by segment:**

\- ***Large DDIC*** – to ***GROW*** by ***high single digit q-o-q*** helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.

\- ***Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC*** (overall) – ***GROW*** ***low teens q-o-q*** and ***&gt;50% yoy***

By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:

\- ***Smartphones*** \-&gt; ***GROW*** ***high teens q-o-q*** &amp; ***&gt;30% yoy***

\- ***Tablet*** \-&gt; flat q-o-q, and

\- ***Automotive*** \-&gt; ***GROW*** ***double-digit q-o-q*** and ***&gt;100% yoy***. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX’s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.

Interestingly within the ***Smartphone*** segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features”.

Also, and more importantly ***“successful engagements with some key customers*** have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches”. i.e. ***winning more market share.***

***Lots to like here.***

***Automotive*** is $HIMX’s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share.

Company notes that the “increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle”.

Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hytzjkzxi9y71.png?width=575&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2040aa5b1ffb16b28ffd7400325710ed38126385

As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a ***non-DDIC segment***\*,\* which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for ***AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.***

This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a ***design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application*** (industrial application, from what I gather) – which is ***on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures)****.*

In addition, $HIMX also notes that the ***number of awarded projects*** in this segment is ***growing rapidly***, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical…”to name a few”. ***Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.***

$HIMX also notes “within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company’s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from ***cloud service providers*** who look for ***secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services***”. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like ***smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.***

$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year.

***This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future***\*.\*

**VALUATION &amp; Conclusion**

The chart below compares Himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.

However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers – with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.

The ***average fair value*** on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 – representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w0zr9jmyi9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f94c1451776d96781b769bcb1c4d4d564f7eb67e

As for ***transaction comps***, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents ***21x EV/EBITDA*** – which if applied to $HIMX, gives a ***FV of $54/share + 370% upside***\*!\*

***Is $54/share possible here?*** Absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a ***few steps ahead of competition*** with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.

We haven’t even discussed $HIMX’s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long-term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).

***But I’d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game”, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.***

***Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary*** – although, that is probably some time away.

For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.

**Let’s squeeze this one dry. GME X’mas special.**

**$HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present.**

**TLDR:**

1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company – trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!

The shares are cheap in a more “normal” S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as ***stupid cheap*** with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation

2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.

3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4’21 and even Q1’22, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have ***consistently delivered results “to guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether***\*.\*

4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year – representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.

5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.

..and now for the fun bit:

6. ***Potential for a significant short squeeze***. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were \~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to \~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.

The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short – and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a **“*****GME X’mas special*****”.**

7. Cant confirm this (***unconfirmed hearsay***) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an ***Asian hedge fund*** which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up….. and it has already shot up \~15% last couple of weeks.

Disclosure: I own stock + Jan’22 and Mar’22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan’22 and $10 Mar’22).

**What does $HIMX do? Products?**

Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here’s a quick snippet of what Himax does:

$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make ‘panels’ which are, in turn, used in:

\- ***Large sized DDICs*** \-&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc

\- ***Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs*** \-&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xauvd0foi9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f100091008d982b11365eddb2f01cd44c01162e

In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:

\- ***High end Timing Controller (TCON)*** which improves power efficiency in displays

\- ***WiseEye ultra power AI*** \--&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ ***AI and ML*** to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet of Things (IoT) area.

**Revenue by segment:**

Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) – with Automotive OEM representing \~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs \~12.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

***However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.***

The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.

**Competitors and Market Shares:**

In the Q3’21 presentation (available [here](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21_HIMX-Investor-Presentation_FInal.pdf)), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).

You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.

&amp;#x200B;

As for ***market share*** by the individual segments, as of Q3’21, $HIMX’s market shares were:

\- Large DDIC: 10.5%

\- Smartphones: 10.4%

\- ***Tablets: 37.7%*** but note that ***$HIMX has &gt; 60% market share*** of Android / non iOS tablets – the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.

\- ***Automotive OEM: 32.8%***

**So, what has been happening recently with Himax?**

2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.

Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products.

$HIMX management ***foresaw*** that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes”, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.

When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially…. and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.

***Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX*** – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX found itself in a very sweet spot.

This gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked. ***When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players),*** [***$HIMX***](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;src=cashtag_click) ***walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!***

This allowed it to ***take a decent amount of market share*** over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dy2osq4ti9y71.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7471bbecf7cdbbeae78af1c495e4dfc1c18cca08

**So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?**

$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) …..but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like ***Internet of Things (IoT)*** and ***Automotive/vehicles***.

In addition, the ***modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV)*** would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that ***this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly***. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.

On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such ***5G and high performance computing (HPC)*** – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its DDIC business used.

In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for, some time ago.

***I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.***

**Isn’t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?**

As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 – this is from a combination of more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.

However, $HIMX was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand…. and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.

$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.

So yes, for now – the demand will persist, and as management has said, ***this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage***\*.\*

Now, that’s the background\*\*.\*\* ***Supply secured along with said demand.***

**SHORT SQUEEZE**

Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear ***Short Squeeze*** candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 – and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the “***GME X’mas special***”.

So, why do I mention a ‘***SHORT SQUEEZE***\*\*’\*\* – well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest is around 24.7m shares, representing \~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting \~11 days to cover.

However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.

Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of “short availability utilization”. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “***GME X’mas special***”.

With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, ***there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.***

[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX) gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) – so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3idfre8ui9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d4484efc50e8d9e3660213ecfcb05b2a828fbe2

As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun’21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.

The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. ***I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs.***

I understand the short-thesis – I really do.

Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.

***The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent guidance seems to suggest otherwise.***

I can personally find ***NO REASON*** to be short this stock anymore at least for the ***next 7 months***, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4’21 and decent outlook for Q1’22) and then we will have a ***dividend payment*** in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).

***From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.***

The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.

***But now, its time for a reversal.***

**The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)**

$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul’21).

The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been \~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.

So far, YTD Q3’21, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.

An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a ***dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!***

***That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.***

The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July – so we have some time. But let’s face it, everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.

Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. ***An earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks.***

Company has bought back shares previously – and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so I wouldn’t put a potential stock buyback past the company.

All in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen \~15% over the last few weeks, it’s quite a surprise that the stock hasn’t rallied much more.

More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).

**A question from the “Growth Bros”: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?**

A common question – and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.

But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light.

So, 2 points worth noting:

1. ***Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is ‘reinvestment***\*\*’\*\*. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
2. ***Reasonably capex-light business***: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.

Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

\- ***R&amp;D*** – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and

\- ***Capex*** \- including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase

In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their ‘investment phase’, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.

**So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so, why hasn’t the share price gone up then?**

Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.

Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20’s performance) as well.

Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/06tfb03vi9y71.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ca55057da0a7bbce8c10570cbf3b69f98cac9a8

Hedge Funds’ share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 – when performance improved dramatically.

Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. ***The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.***

Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.

**So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn’t stock kept pace?**

Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.

Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. ***More on valuation at the end***\*\*.\*\*

***The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION!*** Folks believe that this stock is ***manipulated by Market Makers (MMs)*** who are often option sellers on $HIMX\*\*.\*\* ***Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed***\*\*.\*\*

**With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it’s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!**

**Q3 Earnings**

Now – let’s discuss the recent earnings

***Q3’21 revenue***: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)

***Q3’21 gross margin***: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2’21 and vs 22.3% in Q3’20 (guidance was 50.5-52%)

**Q3’21 EBITDA**: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here!

***Q3’21 Levered FCF*** of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.

The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.

***So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.***

**GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market**

Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.

***Why was the market waiting on guidance?*** Because indications were that:

(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,

(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline)

(c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)

Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure……or at least that’s what the shorts were betting on.

Before I go into $HIMX’s guidance, let’s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) – which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4

\+

its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:

\- Q4’21 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and

\- Q4’21 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.

This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) – so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.

***But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:***

\- ***Q4 revenue*** would ***INCREASE*** by +4% to +8% q-o-q,

\- ***Gross margin***: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)

\- ***Q4 IFRS EPS*** (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.195 i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!

\- ***Q4 non IFRS EPS*** (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)

Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) ***but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!***

To be fair, the ***margin increase is more of a dilutionary effect*** than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.

“It’s simple math”, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX’s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.

However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; ***a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact***\*.\*

***But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through.*** In other words – earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.

This level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)

Mr. Lopez’s question is below:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zvps6kwwi9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1b237c9ee9fb86a957c78f5298eba51ac76f8fd

The answer to this question was pretty much that

a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (*the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 – FY19*), and

b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’.

Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “***again and again and again***” (yes, 3 again’s specifically mentioned) – and notes that guidance this time is no different.

In fact, if you look at $HIMX’s historical guidance, you will see that the company has ***consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1’17) – and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.***

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/got3rshxi9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5f649c842415a00feebddadb2d9d725450fc5f8

So yes – as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this “again and again and again”!!! Let’s just say ***management is highly credible.***

**Top line guidance by segment:**

\- ***Large DDIC*** – to ***GROW*** by ***high single digit q-o-q*** helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.

\- ***Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC*** (overall) – ***GROW*** ***low teens q-o-q*** and ***&gt;50% yoy***

By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:

\- ***Smartphones*** \-&gt; ***GROW*** ***high teens q-o-q*** &amp; ***&gt;30% yoy***

\- ***Tablet*** \-&gt; flat q-o-q, and

\- ***Automotive*** \-&gt; ***GROW*** ***double-digit q-o-q*** and ***&gt;100% yoy***. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX’s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.

Interestingly within the ***Smartphone*** segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features”.

Also, and more importantly ***“successful engagements with some key customers*** have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches”. i.e. ***winning more market share.***

***Lots to like here.***

***Automotive*** is $HIMX’s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share.

Company notes that the “increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle”.

Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hytzjkzxi9y71.png?width=575&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2040aa5b1ffb16b28ffd7400325710ed38126385

As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a ***non-DDIC segment***\*,\* which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for ***AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.***

This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a ***design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application*** (industrial application, from what I gather) – which is ***on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures)****.*

In addition, $HIMX also notes that the ***number of awarded projects*** in this segment is ***growing rapidly***, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical…”to name a few”. ***Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.***

$HIMX also notes “within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company’s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from ***cloud service providers*** who look for ***secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services***”. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like ***smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.***

$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year.

***This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future***\*.\*

**VALUATION &amp; Conclusion**

The chart below compares Himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.

However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers – with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.

The ***average fair value*** on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 – representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w0zr9jmyi9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f94c1451776d96781b769bcb1c4d4d564f7eb67e

As for ***transaction comps***, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents ***21x EV/EBITDA*** – which if applied to $HIMX, gives a ***FV of $54/share + 370% upside***\*!\*

***Is $54/share possible here?*** Absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a ***few steps ahead of competition*** with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.

We haven’t even discussed $HIMX’s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long-term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).

***But I’d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game”, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.***

***Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary*** – although, that is probably some time away.

For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.

guidance time different In fact look HIMX historical guidance see company consistently delivered earnings within guidance least last quarter since Q case either higher end guidance beat altogether amp x B So yes CEO Jordan Wu note company history delivering beating guidance shown Let say management highly credible Top line guidance segment Large DDIC GROW high single digit q q helped growth notebook monitor although TV sale drop slightly due softer end market However HIMX remains positive large DDIC given shortage wafer capacity Small amp Mid sized DDIC overall GROW low teen q q gt yoy By sub segment within small amp mid sized DDIC Smartphones gt GROW high teen q q amp gt yoy Tablet gt flat q q Automotive gt GROW double digit q q gt yoy Stalled capacity restricting HIMX ability meet customer demand significant shortage still persists Interestingly within Smartphone segment HIMX mkt share company note undertaking new design development supporting higher frame rate ultra slim bezel higher resolution feature Also importantly successful engagement key customer achieved Q customer indicating interest next launch e winning market share Lots like Automotive HIMX highest growth area hold growing market share Company note increase number size sophistication display inside vehicle evolving rapid rate indicating much DDIC demand per vehicle Not going write extract Q earnings tell everything need know show positive future business within segment amp x B As noted earlier HIMX also non DDIC segment expected decline Q expected significant growth contributor onwards higher margin This segment includes component AR VR amp IoT application This longer term area worth watching adoption increase last quarter HIMX reported design win top tier name mainstream application industrial application I gather track enter mass production Q result visible figure In addition HIMX also note number awarded project segment growing rapidly covering broad range application including notebook home appliance utility meter automotive battery surveillance camera panoramic video conferencing medical name Some application already slated mass production end year meaning see benefit coming HIMX also note within year since HIMX started sampling company WiseEye solution also drawn much attention cloud service provider look secure low power edge AI device help collect big data cloud based service This open new market frontier area like smart city smart office healthcare agriculture retail factory automation HIMX anticipates design win award growing volume shipment starting next year This segment drive lot growth business future VALUATION amp Conclusion The chart compare Himax valuation v peer note competitor division apart DDIC make direct comp However metric LTM basis HIMX

Salutations fellow ape family this is my first fundamental analysis drop, my ape family has inspired me to share my knowledge with you all. If I am successful I want to share my insights with my ape family.

With that being said welcome to my ted talk, there has been a lot going on during the pandemic and there are a lot of ways to profit; I myself am a poor smooth brained autist but this ape has seen some light. There have been some serious discussions about people refusing to take the vaccine and individuals looking for alternatives there is a divide amongst Americans whether or not to take the COVID vaccine. With all do respect everyone has the right to make a choice to live or die based off whatever they believe. I as an engineer see a problem and look for a solution, and this is what any scientist would do and of course look for a profit based off peoples wants and needs. So I introduce to you all Viatris (VTRS). VTRS was formerly known as Mylan N.V. was a global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company. In November 2020, Mylan merged with Upjohn, Pfizer's off-patent medicine division, to form Viatris. Viatris, Inc. is a global healthcare company, which engages in the provision of access to medicines, sustainable operations. It also offers support services such as diagnostic clinics, educational seminars, and digital tools. The firm operates through the following segments: Developed Markets, Greater China, JANZ, and Emerging Markets. The Developed Markets segment comprises operations primarily in North America and Europe. The Greater China segment includes operations in mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. The JANZ segment consists of operations in Japan, Australia and New Zealand. The Emerging Markets segment encompasses operations with developing markets and emerging economies including countries in Asia, the Middle East, South and Central America, Africa and Eastern Europe. Okay so basically this company is all around the fucking world fellow apes so why the fook am I making such a Donkey Kong big deal…

Well I’m here for you  brethren to connect some motherfookin tendies to all yall. Okay so just recently Pfizer (PFE) has come out with a COVID pill an antiviral that cuts the risk of hospitalization or death by 89% for vulnerable people newly diagnosed with COVID-19. The news I am presenting to you my family is big… we are slowly connecting the dots here bear with  me, I do hope you are enjoying the read though I love you all.

I have linked supporting articles that explain more about the pill I will allow you apes to dig deeper for yourselves…

Alright let’s start connecting these dots… so VTRS operates all around the world literally all around the fookin world, PFE made a pill to treat COVID and VTRS operates all around the world, for those who are unwilling to take a vaccine to save their lives they can simply take a pill… are you apes connecting the dots with me. So if PFE makes a pill what better way to distribute this pill than with VTRS since it already operates all around the world. Yeah that’s right you heard correctly PFE researches the pill VTRS distributes the pill for PFE. I hope this makes sense to you all I encourage you all to do your own research too. Me right now I’m too broke to purchase stock, this shit is way too pricy for my taste. Right now VTRS is trading at $14.56 a share yeah too expensive for my taste, but you know what is not expensive the buy call options… yeah, if I got to learn anything from DeepFuckingValue is that theta decay (time) is either your friend or your enemy. What do I mean you need time for your crop to bear fruit. So what do you think the value of VTRS could be… personally I think it is way undervalued. Yes 14.56 well for me anyways is a lot personally but I believe this shit is going to moon hard. I try to look for the biggest bang for my buck right now you can get a contract that expires Jan 2023 for 10¢ a share that’s $10 for a “lot” meaning 100 shares. 100 contracts for $1,000 isn’t a bad deal. Personally I can’t afford that many but I was able to pick up a quarter of the amount. PFE is trading at about $50 a share at the moment it will probably go to the moon too. But I can’t afford that shit either but I can afford the distributor. I mean to put things into perspective Moderna MRNA was one of the first ones to get approval for a vaccine and the stock went from $20 a share to $450. Okay now lets look at short interest apes lets look under the hood of this baby, I’m using marketbeat it is identified on 10/15/2021 the short interest was at 28,450,000 shares this represents

$17,480,000,000 (market  cap)/$14.56(share price) = 1200549450.55 (available shares)

28,450,000 (SI) /1200549450.55  (available shares) = 0.02369748283 (SI of float)

0.02369748283 (SI of float) \* 100 = 2.369% (SI of float percentage)

The short interest low and personally, I think a short on this stock is an attack not only nefarious but an attack on all human kind.

If we take a  look at the company’s history we can see that it is at historical all time lows which for me this presents a perfect opportunity to capitalize on all time lows for an opportunity to make gains on historical all time highs because of PFE’s revolutionary COVID pill.

My personal opinion take it for a grain of salt; PFE and VTRS will do the same rocket hard. If you don’t want a vaccine fine take a pill.

TL;DR

VTRS go moon; options contracts inexpensive

Options Contracts selling for 10¢ a “lot” for expiry of Jan 2023

I hate being poor

Because the company has only been trading for 2 weeks, it's hard to analyze technicals other than volume. Thankfully, the short interest and float are the main reasons why this stock presents such a great opportunity, so those will be analyzed below.

**Short Interest Stats and Analysis**

To put it simply, the short interest on IRNT is absolutely insane. Combine that with the fact that it's a newly trading company (and susceptible to more volatility) and has a VERY low float, and you have a recipe for an absolute slam dunk.

First, let's take a look at Fintel and iBorrow desk. iBorrowdesk has consistently shown the borrow fee to be over 500% and the available shares to be far below 10,000. Similarly, fintel has consistently showed less than 1,000 shares available to borrow. Though some people don't trust these sites, the similarities in the data help to add credibility

I'd also like to turn your attention to [this post by another WSB user](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pnff3b/irnt_gamma_squeeze_with_213_of_float_claimed_by/). This post analyzes how the extremely low float of this stock due to it being a new stock and the insane option OI presents the opportunity for a legitimate gamma squeeze - not some fake hype run up - a legitimate gamma squeeze similar to GME's first run up.

If you look at websites like Baron's they'll tell you that the SI as a % of the float is only 1.79% (about 700,000 shares). This is correct but doesn't tell the whole story. Because of redemptions and lockups, the actual float is 1.3m shares, which makes the real short interest on tradable shares about 56%. Interestingly, [Ihor's tweet](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1437512870351282177?s=19) shows that the borrow fee is asininely high, which again shows the difficulty of borrowing of this stock and thus the easy possibility of a short squeeze. 56% short interest is an amazing number in and of itself, but that's not the whole story. The thing about this stock that really gets me going is the options activity. The OI on options of this stock is absolutely bananas right now. Remember when I said that there are about 1.3M tradable shares due to it being a new stock post-merger? Well, at a $20 price, almost double that amount is held in ITM calls alone. THAT is why the stock has serious gamma squeeze potential. Remember, both the GME and VW squeezes happened because ITM options OI outnumbered the float of companies that were already heavily shorted - this is the power of a gamma squeeze. Most meme stocks that have been ""squeezing"" recently have been small short squeezes due to retail traders and HFs taking advantage of social sentiment. The reason that we haven't seen a violent squeeze recently is because there hasn't been a stock with options activity like this - until IRNT.

Additionally, you probably saw that the stock went up to almost $40 last week out of nowhere. Again, this is the power of a low float stock with high ITM call OI. If this stock starts picking up, the low float and call OI could propel it to meme stock legend status.

Furthermore, data from ortex has also consistently shown a SI of over 300% and a cost to borrow over 500%, which is consistent with the sources listed above. Yes, the SI is definitely a plus, but again, the real power here is the gamma squeeze potential.

(The above four paragraph's were heavily borrowed from the originally linked user, so please check out his post).

Many people will probably not believe some of these shorting numbers and will consider them unreliable because of how new the stock is. That's understandable. However, if you're in that camp, let me present to you this: the NYSE's regulationSHO FTD list. Per SEC regulations, stocks that reach over a certain amount of FTDs are placed on regulation SHO's threshold list. This is a very small list and identifies stocks that are grossly over-shorted (FTDs being the evidence of that). GME was on this list for a very long time before it squeezed. So if you don't believe the websites's SI numbers, then you at least have to believe the NYSE's numbers about FTDs. When a stock has too many FTDs, it means that it is extremely hard to locate shares and repay borrowers, which is a sign of over-shorting. Here is the NYSE list:

https://preview.redd.it/z5q0vbtmxjn71.png?width=2710&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e76c960abd9f88936b898b3dbebbf5d82519a9cb

Notice the second to last one? DING DING DING. Though being on the threshold list signifies overshorting, there is yet another thing that we can take from this - forced covering. IRNT has been on that list since 9/2. Per regulationSHO, after 6 TRADING days on the list (9/10), stricter location requirements for shorting are put in place. Take a look at the giant green uptick that we saw on 9/10. 13 TRADING days on the list and forced coverings start taking place where a market-maker is subject to fines and loses his or her market making abilities if this regulation is violated. 13 TRADING days after 9/2 is 9/21. Remember all of those call options I talked about above, well they will be exercised on Friday 9/17. So, let's review what we have: an extremely high reported short interest (you can believe it's 600%, 300%, 56%, whatever), an extremely low an restricted float, ITM options expiring on Friday that outnumber the total float, the stock being on the threshold list indicating over-shorting, forced coverings taking place right around when those options would have to be delivered. Again, this is exactly what we saw with GME. It's important to note however, that this is also an issue of timing - the stock is likely to have a gamma squeeze sometime late this week and through next week. After that, there's a good chance that covering could lead to the stock being taken off of the threshold list.

**Fundamentals**

Think that IRNT is just a squeezable meme stock with no long term potential as an investment? Wrong. The stock is not like most meme stocks - it actually is a good underlying business. According to an article by a website not allowed on here (just copy and past the quote in google to find it), ""With the company’s international expansion, M&amp;A initiatives, and cloud acceleration, under my most optimistic case scenario, the company is worth $55 per share. If IronNet continues to sign agreements with nation states and companies like CrowdStrike did, I believe that the upside potential is significant."" The article discusses how the company's AI initiatives, cyber security focus, and cloud acceleration, all of which are some of the most important and up and coming technology sectors, poise it to go up in value significantly. Additionally, the company also just reported earnings. Though the earnings were lower than expected, take a look at the after hours activity - the shorts have no juice left.

**Conclusion/TL;DR**

So there you have it. in my opinion, IRNT is an EXTREMELY good stock fundamentally so I will be holding it long term. HOWEVER, the stock also presents a rare gamma squeeze - short squeeze opportunity that retail hasn't seen since GME. The stock has an extremely high reported short interest, an extremely small float, open interest on ITM call options that outnumbers the current float, is on the regulationSHO threshold list indicating that it has extremely high short interest and possible naked shorting, has been on that list for a significant amount of time, and the ITM options that outnumber the float are expiring right around when shorts would be forced to cover their FTDs. In other words, an absolute grand slam.

Previous DD post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pnff3b/irnt_gamma_squeeze_with_213_of_float_claimed_by/)

I wanted to provide an update on the gamma squeeze in $IRNT that I've been following heading into Wednesday and some final thoughts before it runs.

*Quickly touching on the surprise earnings release. There wasn't an announcement of the earnings, so there wasn't really a warning they would be dropping this evening. This honestly doesn't change anything as this isn't a fundamental play and I wouldn't look to deep into AH movements on a low float stock like this. $IRNT will very likely resume it's run tomorrow unimpeded.*

Since my last post the percentage of float claimed by institutional obligations has increased from 213% to **273%** as of close today with short interest (as of the last numbers) taking up 56% of the float and options ITM OI accounting for 217%.

The intraday movements of the past two days have indicated that tomorrow will likely be the ""start of the squeeze"". So with that, I offer some price targets should this start to run tomorrow (these are peak targets). I personally expect it to start running tomorrow and hit peak either Thursday or Friday, more-so weighted towards Friday.

Likely Guaranteed: **$29**  
Likely: **$40**  
If everything goes right: **$135**  
If it matches other squeezes: **$210**  
If it goes to the moon: **$530**

Take these price targets with a grain of salt. The only two that should matter right now are the first two, once those are broken, the others become more relevant and probably *more likely* very quickly.

As I said in the other post, this situation is highly unusual and the low float on this stock enables it to run really fast and really hard when buy volume comes in. This also makes this play very risky so only partake with money that you can afford to lose.

**Good luck and godspeed gentlemen.**

In theory, this should work in reverse. Mass buying of puts would cause them to hedge with short share positions. They do not care which way a stock is going, they only care that no matter how the stock moves, they are not losing money.

A year ago today retail was trading GME on the 100% correct thesis\* that it was shorted more than 100% of the float and THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE WERE TRADING ON --- THE CONTINUED BUY PRESSURE of a 100% shorted stock and potential squeeze (an actual squeeze, not the BS that's been mentioned with every MSM article mentioning a new ticker squeeze candidate ever since).

Well instead of letting the ""free market"" play out, the monopoly game was flipped upside down because they didn't like how the game was playing out…i.e., the buy button was simply turned off for multiple securities.

If you have not seen Interactive Brokers Founder and Chariman Thomas Pettery's interview February 2021 before the gamestop hearings, this is the most important concise background info as to what was actually going on behind the scenes 1/28/21 and it MUST BE WATCHED here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_TPYuIRVfew&amp;t=41s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TPYuIRVfew&amp;t=41s)

You know…confirming the thesis that many were trading on in January 2021 was 100% correct.

This is full admission that the price would have gone into the thousands, so brokers purposely shut off the buy pressure 1/28/21 to keep GME from going exponential to save their own skin…OR it's a lot like rewriting the rules of the game and breaking the opponents legs at the same time in the 4th quarter.

In turning off just the buy pressure (and not the sell pressure) they straight up robbed retail in broad daylight with the police watching and the world recording it on their phones and these people running the shit show are still out there as if NO WRONG has occurred. Shutting off just the buy pressure instead of halting trading overall artificially affected the supply and demand for the securities they did this to. THIS IS STRAIGHT THE FUCK UP MARKET MANIPULATION as defined by the SEC and cost retail share holders and long option holders BILLIONS of dollars.

We have a nasty habit of looking at the past 30-40 years (which is a huge bulk of our lives), and thinking it is the status quo. We draw on it to make decisions. The past 30-40 years are just a snippet of time. Between technological revolutions, data sharing, unrest, unpredictable economic decisions, the digitization of everything including money, but more importantly information... I think it is safe to say we are entering uncharted waters. 


I have always been, and will remain a ""Time in the market beats timing the market"", that being said, anyone that comments on anything regarding investing with absolute confidence, is a fool and should not be listened to in these current times. 


The human species is entering a new era, at a rapid pace. We are in a ferrari with the pedal to the metal and wearing a blindfold. You can try to make well informed decisions, and it doesn't matter. The world is in arguably the most unpredictable state that it has ever been in throughout human history. 


In 20 years of investing, everything at this point feels like straight up gambling, from choosing insurance policies, taking on a mortgage, trying to plan for utility costs, investing, hell... Just trying to plan for the future. 

If you look at the last 10 years, and try to apply it to the next 10 years, you might be in for a wild ride. Ultimately, our current economic structure is built on compound infinite growth **forever**.  I've always invested with that in mind, yet...

With the price of **WTI Crude Oil** breaking through key resistance at $75 per barrel (currently at $75.74), it is now wide open to trade all of the way up to the **next line of resistance at $104 per barrel**.  There is no more resistance to fight the trend higher until WTI hits $104 per barrel which is the next line in the sand.

Goldman Sachs and every major analyst predicts WTI crude oil prices will trade up to **$90 per barrel or higher by year end.**

**Vaneck** **Oilfield Services ETF (OIH)** has the highest short interest since January and is set to blast higher as oil producers ramp up their capex to extract more oil from their rigs.   Last year during COVID, oil producers stopped spending capex money to maintain their rigs or add new rigs.  They cut back everywhere they could to save money.  There is now over a $300 Billion postponed capex for just last year, let alone the shortfall we have in 2021 as crude oil prices surge higher.

Now that WTI is trading above $75, oil producers are scrambling to play catch up with their deferred oil rig maintenance and expansion of new drilling rigs to position themselves to take advantage of the surging higher prices for crude.

**OIH** has already put in a double bottom at $165 in May and then again last month and now trades at $204.49.  The trend is now higher.

Meanwhile **there is a major shortfall in the Supply of oil versus the surging Demand for Oil**.  As world economies reopen after COVID the Demand for Oil is soaring.  The massive imbalance between supply vs. demand should push WTI prices above $90 per barrel by year end according to Goldman Sachs.

The world is currently producing a shortfall of 4 million barrels a day less than actual demand.  As the economy reopening occurs, this Demand/Supply imbalance will undoubtedly steepen.

The Oil Services and Equipment companies that comprise **OIH** trimmed back their own spending, paid down their debt, and went lean and mean during last year's pullback in capex during 2020.  They too tried to cut back and save money everywhere possible.  As a result of going mean and lean, their profit margins percentages (%) now are at all time highs to take advantage of the surge in capex spending by oil producers.   **OIH** **is poised to produce outlandishly high profits this quarter in Q4, and in Q1 next year.**

**OIH** has already popped 24% higher last month from $164 to $204 last month in September with a huge upside remaining.

**OIH has historically traded at $600 per share or higher (currently at $204) whenever WTI crude traded at $80 per barrel.**  

As a matter of fact, **OIH traded above $1,100 per share the last time WTI traded at $104 per barrel.**

*IMHO:  The short squeeze is imminent as OIH pushes higher.*

Hedge Funds, Mutual Funds, Pension Funds, and other professional money managers are all caught offsides and are way underweight **OIH** in their portfolios.  They will be forced to pile into **OIH** to play catchup this quarter.  None of them can afford to have their investors question why they are underweight the best performing sector at year-end.  For their very own survival, money managers have to jump onboard to get ahead of the surging demand for oil services and equipment as the world economies reopen and the recovery takes place.

Not Financial Advice, burn money at your own risk.

**TL;DR - negative sentiments, high short interest, crowd favorite. Probably down, but shrek is still in the vicinity.**

**Ticker - Chewy (CHWY)**

**Price - 57$**

**Earnings - 12/09/2021 AH**

**Category - Digital Retail** 

**Macro - Mixed, Logistics (expensive fulfillment)  vs Sentiments (people love pets)**

**Macro + Fundamental**

Chewy has been a covid winner due to stay-at-home increasing the rate of pet adoption. However, as a retailer, Chewy faces the same problems of logistical bottlenecks and increased labor costs due to their focus on quality distribution and fulfillment. Chewy is traded on its massive revenue and user growth, rather than a measure of its PE. Chewy’s problem here is twofold: first, despite the massive revenue, Chewy typically loses money per quarter. Second is the stagnating pet-adoption post-peak. Given its slow drain of sub 25 million per quarter and a cash balance of over 500m, I believe there is little risk of dilution. The key metrics to look at are: Gross margins, Customer numbers, and total lifetime-value (LTV)

**Technical**

PC ratio volume is at 1.57 and PC ratio OI is about 1.36 both of which are bearish. RSI is about 30, oversold. Implied movement about 14% or about $9. Short interest is 20% of float, with 3.4 days to cover. Given the magnitude of the last few months for Chewy, I believe a reasonable support lies at 40, or the March 2020 initial buying. Fib retracement at current levels are very difficult to pin and not considered. Given the high short interest, a gap up to 70 is likely on a positive beat and raise, with topside target being 80$. 

**Sentimental**

Everyone think its overvalued due to its sky high PE and lack of consistent profitability. While I agree its an optics issue, Amazon was not profitable for a long time though they were growing revenue very quickly. However, there is a high chance of stagnation, as lease for this quarter, on revenue growth due to the stagnation of pet adoptions. Recently, CHWY partnered up with Trupanion for pet insurance that will roll out spring 2022. This is a great move to improve revenue and monetize the user-base while not providing the insurance infrastructure themselves. SA quant rating is 2.62 out of 5. SA Author ratings slightly better at 3.5. Wall Street Ratings at 3.9, with price target average of about 93$, highest being 133 and lowest being 51. This also opens up for downgrades if performance is lackluster. Twitter is mostly negative, as is stockwits and wallstreetbets. (this means retail is predominately bearish)

**Given the high short interest, shorting calls/call spreads feel dangerous. Selling puts at the 40 level feels like the baseline play. IV is high enough to negate a lot of profitability for lesser movements, so net sell is logical. For those that want to play downside, I suggest a 12/17 put debit spread.**   


As best practice - if you're selling options for earnings, wait til 10 minutes before closing to do so to maximize IV and negate intra-day movements. If net buy, set levels and buy at levels.","CHEWY Earnings 12/9/2021 AH - High short interest, low expectations",53,1,"CHEWY Earnings 12/9/2021 AH - High short interest, low expectations There were some good DD posted, so I just filed in some gaps and provided another opinion.

Antara is receiving around 15M shares, that has been added to the 1.6M shares that they already owned which means that they will now own around 9% of the WKHS float.

What is Stock Sentiment?

When making investment decisions, sentiment gives a good overview of what stocks investors currently favor. Sentiment incorporates short-term technical analysis into its score and does not encompass any fundamental analysis such as profitability of the company. This means that earnings updates and other news can greatly impact overall sentiment. Changes in price are generally the best indicator of sentiment for a particular stock. At its core, a stock's trend indicates whether current market sentiment is bullish or bearish. Investors must be bullish if a stock is trending upward, and are bearish if a stock is moving down. InvestorsObserver's Sentiment Indicator factors in both price changes and variations in volume. An increase in volume usually means a current trend is stengthening, while a drop in volume tends to signal a reversal to the ongoing trend. Our system also uses the options market in order to receive additional signals on current sentiments. We take into account the ratio of calls and puts for a stock since options allow an investor to bet on future changes in price.

The PE ratio sits at about 3.63, with the industry average being about 22.  This is absolutely incredible for any company, but does not bring about complete justice.  Its price to book ratio sits at about 0.62, which anything under 1 is considered a deep value.  It also seems to have great future growth with a PEG sitting at about 0.62 which considers estimates of future earnings to current ones.  The company currently holds a net margin of  4.13%, with an industry standard of 3.70%.  Tight profit margins in electronics manufacturing with the ongoing pandemic have made it a challenge to navigate, and this company seems to be excelling.

Insider selling has been putting significant downward selling pressure on SGMA, with the director recently retiring and selling her stock along with others selling presumably to raise more cash for the upcoming WAGZ acquisition which currently produces $9 million in revenue.  The small float is something to look out for, with almost 33% shorted as of today!  The price has been plummeting, seemingly putting a fire sale on the company.  The only thing that would make me smile more is SigmaTron releasing pro forma statement on future growth with the WAGZ acquisition.  I cannot possibly comprehend the amount of insider selling when a new acquisition is on the rise and a record net income was formed for the company's lifetime.  They seem to be repositioning in my opinion, and it just seems like a great opportunity that cannot be missed.  A short squeeze could be inevitable, but that is besides the point.

**Target;** DISC trades at a significant discount in forward EV/EBITDA (x8.45) compared to competitors NFLX (x32.7) and DISNEY (x22). ARPU stands to grow from $7 - $11 at merger, an increase of 57%.

The DISC merger, expected in Q2 2022 - where T spins off its Warner Media division (including HBO) to form NewCo is one of the biggest upcoming deals this year.

Looking at the IP portfolio for newco is staggering - 200000 hours of content spanning WB, HBO, TLC, DISC, HGTV, TNT, CNN, Olympics and more. It spans a massive content sector (specific to un/scripted reality-tv, sports, major film releases for the remaining cable-cutting audience that consumes this particular content) for the streaming industry that is lacking in the current streaming ecosystem (eg, most of this material was pulled from Hulu). DISC carries massive international potential through its reach across 220+ countries and 50 languages (eg, [DISC holds exclusive rights for Olympics broadcasting in Europe until 2024 - with the next Olympics around the corner - valued at 1.4B](https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-awards-all-tv-and-multiplatform-broadcast-rights-in-europe-to-discovery-and-eurosport-for-2018-2024-olympic-games)). There's no question the content library is there, but what about the numbers.

With an TTM PE of 17 (vs. NFLX 53, DISNEY 142) and only 20M subscribers vs. NFLX 240M and DISNEY 118M - and an estimated newco growth to \~100M via the merger this year (76M via HBO Max, 22M from DISC) the potential for growth is quite apparent. The combined Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) stands to be $11/user, or 1.10B/month or 13.2B/year with a free cash flow of 7.83B/year. With DISC ARPU currently at approximately $7, this is a 57% gain in ARPU immediately at merger. With an extremely conservative estimate of a mere 5% user growth per year, we reach approximately 130M subscribers by 2026. Management forecasts cost-savings through the merger (reducing marketing spend of independent entities into one), but say ARPU remains consistent in the worst case scenario, that increases revenue to 1.43B for 2026 of 17.16B/year. The two companies currently produce an average FCF at around 59%, which again, in the worst case scenario (remaining flat) brings us to a conservative estimate for FCF of 10.3B/year. Future CEO, David Zaslav [points to a long term goal of 400M subscribers](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/17/david-zaslav-on-subscriber-goals-for-combined-discovery-warnermedia.html) which would bring this estimate even higher.

Management has expressed expectations to reduce gross debt down from 5.0x gross debt/EBITDA within a few years. Given the conservative FCF growth estimate of 33%, this seems reasonable.

T holders receive 71% in newco, DISC holders receive remaining 29%. This presents a potential 112.45B EV and 60B of debt for a total market cap of 52.45B for newco, and an estimated 2.4m shares outstanding at the current price \~ $22.90.

**Disclosure;** I am long DISCA and DISCK.

**Target;** DISC trades at a significant discount in forward EV/EBITDA (x8.45) compared to competitors NFLX (x32.7) and DISNEY (x22). ARPU stands to grow from $7 - $11 at merger, an increase of 57%.

The DISC merger, expected in Q2 2022 - where T spins off its Warner Media division (including HBO) to form NewCo is one of the biggest upcoming deals this year.

Looking at the IP portfolio for newco is staggering - 200000 hours of content spanning WB, HBO, TLC, DISC, HGTV, TNT, CNN, Olympics and more. It spans a massive content sector (specific to un/scripted reality-tv, sports, major film releases for the remaining cable-cutting audience that consumes this particular content) for the streaming industry that is lacking in the current streaming ecosystem (eg, most of this material was pulled from Hulu). DISC carries massive international potential through its reach across 220+ countries and 50 languages (eg, [DISC holds exclusive rights for Olympics broadcasting in Europe until 2024 - with the next Olympics around the corner - valued at 1.4B](https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-awards-all-tv-and-multiplatform-broadcast-rights-in-europe-to-discovery-and-eurosport-for-2018-2024-olympic-games)). There's no question the content library is there, but what about the numbers. 

With an TTM PE of 17 (vs. NFLX 53, DISNEY 142) and only 20M subscribers vs. NFLX 240M and DISNEY 118M - and an estimated newco growth to \~100M via the merger this year (76M via HBO Max, 22M from DISC) the potential for growth is quite apparent. The combined Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) stands to be $11/user, or 1.10B/month or 13.2B/year with a free cash flow of 7.83B/year. With DISC ARPU currently at approximately $7, this is a 57% gain in ARPU immediately at merger. With an extremely conservative estimate of a mere 5% user growth per year, we reach approximately 130M subscribers by 2026. Management forecasts cost-savings through the merger (reducing marketing spend of independent entities into one), but say ARPU remains consistent in the worst case scenario, that increases revenue to 1.43B for 2026 of 17.16B/year. The two companies currently produce an average FCF at around 59%, which again, in the worst case scenario (remaining flat) brings us to a conservative estimate for FCF of 10.3B/year. Future CEO, David Zaslav [points to a long term goal of 400M subscribers](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/17/david-zaslav-on-subscriber-goals-for-combined-discovery-warnermedia.html) which would bring this estimate even higher.

Management has expressed expectations to reduce gross debt down from 5.0x gross debt/EBITDA within a few years. Given the conservative FCF growth estimate of 33%, this seems reasonable.

T holders receive 71% in newco, DISC holders receive remaining 29%. This presents a potential 112.45B EV and 60B of debt for a total market cap of 52.45B for newco, and an estimated 2.4m shares outstanding at the current price \~ $22.90.

\--

Finally, for those of you that like a short squeeze, DISCA currently holds a FF% of 13.5% and DTC of 10.14 (compare to AMC 20%, 2.35, GME 16.46% 4.37, SNDL 18.6% 3.38) according to the latest data from Ortex.",DD - DISCOVERY: DISCK Don't Fail Me Now - Balls Deep Value for 2022,1,1,"DD - DISCOVERY: DISCK Don't Fail Me Now - Balls Deep Value for 2022 **TLDR;** This stock has been battered out of the Archegos scandal and concerns over debt in the upcoming merger, but is surprisingly overlooked as a potential value play in a market that is starved for value, and long overdue for a reasonable return after nearly a year of capitulation.

With the rise of Metaverse, i've tried to look at which companies might benefit from this new secular movement. there are obvious choices like $U and $NVDA. but i was looking at companies with smaller marketcap and flying under the radar where it can potentially have a big pop as this movement towards metaverse gets bigger.

The company name is Immersion Corporation. They are the developer and licensor for haptic technology. So things like 3D touch with apple, Dual sense joystick for PS5, are all using patents from IMMR. As they're a tech company creating patents, and other companies can/should pay for for its patent use. Previously, they sued several companies like Apple and Microsoft and won. My thesis is that alot of hardware vendors (Facebook Oculus, 3rd party AR/VR providers, Apple) might guarantee a future revenue stream for IMMR as the metaverse explodes.

The company marketcap is around 200 Million USD and has small short interest of around 3.4%. They probably had management issues as it can be seen from insider's selling and CEO resigning (maybe due to bad management as they could potentially more from companies that use their tech, they have more than 3200 patents).

Technically, the stock needs to above 12, and then 15 to see an aggressive move to the upside of around 22.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, they are in an ETF named Meta, where the stock is next big giants, like Apple, NVDA, Microsoft, Facebook ,etc. so any buying into this META etf will do them well in my opinion.

Also, they are in an ETF named Meta, where the stock is next big giants, like Apple, NVDA, Microsoft, Facebook ,etc. so any buying into this META etf will do them well in my opinion.

The company name is  Immersion Corporation. They are the developer and licensor for haptic technology. So things like 3D touch with apple, Dual sense joystick for PS5, are all using patents from IMMR. As they're a tech company creating patents, and other companies can/should pay for for its patent use. Previously, they sued several companies like Apple and Microsoft and won.  My thesis is that alot of hardware vendors (Facebook Oculus, 3rd party AR/VR providers, Apple) might guarantee a future revenue stream for IMMR as the metaverse explodes. 

The company marketcap is around 200 Million USD and has small short interest of around 3.4%. They probably had management issues as it can be seen from insider's selling and CEO resigning (maybe due to bad management as they could potentially more from companies that use their tech, they have more than 3200 patents).

I would also like to say, I have tried to use as many pictures as I can for easy processing, and I have tried to organize this the best I can, but it's a lot of data, and I'm 4 hours into this at the time of writing this, so I am sorry if it's a little messy sometimes.

I am a numbers person.  I don't like fluff, and hype.  I like facts, and results.  I'm a software engineer, I like logic, it's my world lens, and I'm here to share with you why I think GME has to be one of the best plays in the market, if not the best play right now.

I have some cash sitting in my bank ready to get some more as I try to time the dip, which I believe will be sometime between now, and the middle of Febuary, and with this cash, I plan to get some June 17th 130c, and 150c, and some shares with whatever is left.  I'll now explain why I'm going for June 130c's, 150c's, and why I am still bullish on GME in the medium term (6 months)

**DD Start:**

I'll start with the crayons, since that's what most of you will scroll to first anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

[Don't put too much weight into this, it's just a visual representation for me to reference timestamps on the graph as I explain where we've been, and where we're going.](https://preview.redd.it/gp5asx0n2y981.png?width=974&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78a7ab496fb5a3e71842663da36df89a8cc1a4f5)

My TA is worthless without some explanation, so I have tried to label things as clearly as I can, to make this as easy to digest as possible, no fiber necessary ;)

The orange boxes represent the historical price ranges in the Jan -&gt; July window over the last 3 years.

The flags indicate the first trading day of the year, and July 17th, for each trading window

The yellow line is kind of like a candle within the orange box which I use to gauge my own expectations when charting.  This is a personal strategy, has little to do with the overall DD, but helps keep a frame of reference IMO.

Then, finally, the red boxes which are numbered.  These will be used as reference points to talk about GME, and their actions, and market sentiment for those trading windows.

My analysis of a company comes from actions that a company is taking to position themselves for the future, not where they are positioned today.  After all, you make money when you're early, not when you're late, and we all know hard hard it can be to time the market, especially as options traders, it's a core element of what we do, or try to do.

**#1, 2019 In Review:**

Ahhhhh  yes, 2019, covid isn't here yet, the world is running as it was designed to, and GME is a dying brick and motor company being led by an experienced brick and motor CEO, and executives, trying to survive in the gaming industry, arguably, one of the most technologically adoptive industries in the market.  The CEO decided to direct the company into primary collectables, and used hardware, and disks.  Essentially, a death sentence for the company.  It's clearly on a downtrend, since the retail sentiment, along with the wall street sentiment is that the company won't survive for 5 more years.

* **Game sales are primary digital** at this point.
* GameStop **has sizable debt** at this point.
* Their revenues, and sales, are clearly, and **rapidly declining**.
* The **leadership** constantly shouting 'multi-channel e-commerce business' as if that means anything anymore.
* GameStop looks like it's on the fast track to zero, as it should be based on it's **future market positioning**, and **leadership**.

At this point, GME has been shorted into oblivion, both by wallstreet, and retail, it's just not looking good for the company, anyone here could agree with that, except for maybe DFV, and other early GME bulls, but even they'd say it's risky at this point, and it might not work out.

This is just used as an example to show where the company was 2 years ago, which has significant influence when you're trying to gauge how fast a company can turn around, and make shifts in an industry.  We'd all be able to agree that 2019 GME, and 2021 GME are different beasts, although, with some of the same existing problems, which I'll touch on later.

&amp;#x200B;

**#2 (part 1), The Burrrrrry Chapter**

This is an interesting one, since there is a pretty significant spike in the share price, followed by a meltdown to previous levels.  There wasn't any news regarding GME actions at this time, however, there was an activist hedge fund who was invested into the company at the time, Scion Capital, which is managed by Michael Burrrrrrry.  From here, things get interesting, I'll try to use as many pictures as I can to keep your attention.

Lets start with the SEC filing for the purchase Scion Capital made of 3.4 million GME shares.

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/0001649339\/000090514820000491\/efc20-335\_sc13d.htm ](https://preview.redd.it/hujye2if3y981.png?width=339&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68ebfa57e8e8c18a0af688fd8eb5b8e48844c210)

Then, prior to the filing, Mr. Burrrrry wrote a letter to the GameStop Board of Directors, which I **STRONGLY RECOMMEND** reading, sorry if the screenshots are too small, CBA to enlarge the page, source is included in the caption.

**Part 1:**

&amp;#x200B;

[Just goes to show the INSANE short conviction, which later detailed by the proof of naked shorts by the SEC is not shocking since the only way out is to admit to illegal activity for SHF, and market makers involved.](https://preview.redd.it/ltk4re5m3y981.png?width=697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33ec24a6a205a419a59cde870a39f666daa2e0c6)

As you can see by the dates I have highlighted above, Michael Burry suggested to GameStop that they are heavily, and unreasonably sold short, since they have more cash on-hand publicly than their company is even being valued at.  This is a huge red-flag for a term called '[death spiral financing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_spiral_financing)'.  Michael Burry caught it in the very early phases by pointing out that they had debt accruing, and enough money to pay it off, while also doing a share buyback, and expressed concern that the company leadership had chosen to not take that action yet.  He also suggested to combat the overwhelming short interest that was building on GME.  This is extremely evident looking back due to data given by the SEC GameStop investigation/report that was published (see image below), along with Michael Burrys own provided data in his letter.

This is a big part of what led to the **January 2021 sneeze**.

As you can see, the 13D filing Michael Burrrrry filed is dated 'April 2nd, 2019', which directly correlates to the graph, as the spike here starts on April 3rd, **the day after the letter was delivered to the GME leadership**, and brings the stock price from $2.67 at the low on April 9th, to the peak of $6.40 on April 14th.  This is the time-frame where Scion capital made it's GME purchase of 3.4 million shares.

&amp;#x200B;

**#2 (part 2) The Ryan Cohen Chapter (this happened between #2, and #3 on my graph)**

Quick backstory on RC before we move on:

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ryan\_Cohen ](https://preview.redd.it/tkpbuc4s2y981.png?width=2145&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c1929451cff13da12e1303068d3eb9044d061f7)

Long story short, he took a company from round 1 VC funding in 2013 @ 15 million, to selling the company in 2017 for $3.35 billion, which was the largest e-commerce acquisition of all time.  That's a 4 year timeline from nothing to billions.  Innovative, disruptive, and efficient.

Between #2, and #3 on my chart, RC made his initial purchases of GME shares, which he filed in his 13D filing of his investment company, RC Ventures LLC, which was a total of 5.8 million shares, pictured below.

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/fintel.io\/doc\/sec-gme-gamestop-rc-ventures-llc-sc-13d-2020-august-28-18502 \(scroll to bottom\)](https://preview.redd.it/w8eu9ddt2y981.png?width=1903&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5ba1f9e8845017ade3cf6de72cc361dedfb9e71)

RC made 6 purchases, the first being over 5% of the company, which required him to file a 13D, and the rest being adding to that position, which required a 13D/A, essentially adding to a position greater than 5% of the outstanding shares of a company, used for almost all hostile takeovers.  You will see the green boom boom candles between #2, and #3 directly correlate to the days that these filings are created.

&amp;#x200B;

[httpsL\/\/fintel.io\/if\/rc-ventures-llc](https://preview.redd.it/l79unusp3y981.png?width=1864&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c24aff60f6085ff245b32821faa75724ec3ef11)

RC wrote a letter to the GameStop Board of Directors as well, saying to follow a new direction of becoming a tech company, allowing digital trade-ins, and a customer first approach.  I **HIGHLY RECOMMEND** reading this, since it's from the single largest shareholder of GME since Jan 1st, 2021, a man who turned $15M into $3.35B in a mere 4 years.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**#3 The Sneeze, the Awakening, DFV, and You**

This is the part of the graph that I feel needs no explanation really, that is, if you were here a year ago.  We were jacked on Tesla, and GME.  DFV finally was popular after about a year of his bleeding calls posts, and was in the green, thanks to Michael Burry, Ryan Cohen, and his own understanding of where this company was going, and the relentless SI.

&amp;#x200B;

[The Roaring Kitty](https://preview.redd.it/0bef8zqq3y981.png?width=1283&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e26600e067e3e502dee663586ffca6c94dd58919)

We here, on WSB, love options plays, especially options plays that have a lot of research.  A lot of analytical background, and that were drawn up with crayons, and memes.

While #2 was happening, WSB was growing, and GME was one of the most talked about stocks, both in a positive, and negative lights here.  Lots of people got their stimulus checks, and also were on Reddit, and for some reason, those wonderful retards that WSB was a place for good investment advice, bless their souls, they didn't know better at the time, hell, some still don't.

WSB grew from 2 million users, to 10 million users in the time-span between #2, and #3.  If you were here for that, you know it was chaos, and you probably remember the talks of 'the end of the OG WSB'.  In a lot of ways, that was very accurate, and in other ways, it was less accurate, WSB has evolved, for sure, lots of meaningless DD flared posts, shills, and way more retards playing FD's than ever.  Just look at the TSLA posts this last week, and you'll see that there is still an embodiment of what WSB stands for.

I'm getting sentimental, so I'll leave it there, just know, I love you retards.

**Adding Up The Facts**

Michael Burry pointed out in his letter that there was an insane amount of SI, and that more shares were trading for GME at the time, than shares that should be possible to trade, IE, 'naked shorts'.  The SEC confirmed this for us earlier this year with their GameStop investigation:

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/files\/staff-report-equity-options-market-struction-conditions-early-2021.pdf ](https://preview.redd.it/20545ass3y981.png?width=569&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbdb4210c2853825f80d77c12441870af60de5df)

On December 31st, 2020, GME had more than 100% short interest confirmed by the SEC, AKA, naked shorts.  To clarify, this means that without a shadow of a doubt, not a \*\*NOT A SINGLE SHARE WAS AVAILABLE\*\* to be sold long on the day December 31st, 2020, in a fair, and free market.  The SEC also confirms in this investigation that the shorts didn't close during the January run-up, they diamond handed, and hoped for the best, a feeling many of us know all too well.

This now brings us to January 3rd, 2021, WSB is growing massively, most people just barely got their stimulus in the mail/direct deposited, and are ready to throw it into the wall street casino.  They do what the average retard would do, buy some shares, and OTM weeklies/monthlies based on DD that was posted by some internet stranger (this time it's me, what's up), and knowing that there are \*\*ZERO SHARES AVAILABLE FOR GME AS OF THE LAST FRIDAY\*\*,  this puts extreme pressure on brokers, since they can't locate the shares.  They can't internalize.  They are fucked, market makers are fucked, SHF are fucked, and the DTCC + NSCC are freaking out.  They internally agree to turn off the buy button across a series of clearing houses, which forces brokers to turn their buy buttons off.

RH got the wrist slap from this, but don't forget, Webull, Public, T212, and many others also turned the buy button off.  This is because they got direct orders from Apex Clearing that they cannot process buy orders.  This requires some of the small SHF to buy-back shares from us, WSB.  We gave them the biggest, dirtiest middle finger we could.  We essentially took down Melvin Capital, P72, Citron, and many others.

We were all fucked by the buy button being turned off, since the majority of us had calls, which expire worthless if not exercised, and not enough money to exercise.  Many made money, more lost money, SHF's got bailed out by Citadel, their market maker, and partner in crime, and supposedly, life was supposed to keep going as if nothing happened?

Fuck no, we diamond handed that shit, at least many of us did.  We had been talking on WSB about the possible squeeze for MONTHS.  We're not going out without a fight, we doubled the fuck down, tripled down, diamond handed, exercised OTM calls, and did everything we could to put as much pressure as we could on those that took everything from us in 2008, 1970, etc.  We finally had the ace, they were wrong, we won.

The NSCC, and DTCC waived all fees, and SHF, and Citadel created massive can kicked positions to deal with the volume that they didn't have on-hand.  They bent the rules, and tried to force us out.  Looking at the graph again, this is the best part.

**#3, and #4 We're Still Here, and The Shorts Are Still There:**

There's clearly apes here, GameStop sold 5m shares into the market to raise $1.7B  in cash, there's still practically no float (which we can prove without a doubt now, thanks to GameStop filing their latest quarterly report), and shorts still are in the play, naked, or not.  They stated that there was 5M shares registered with CS as of Oct. 30st, 2021.  This was over a quarter ago, and here is the data gathered by apes since then.

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.computershared.net ](https://preview.redd.it/505q558u3y981.png?width=2097&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87cbc508575c13fd4caa2cbc92a3b45367526d2d)

According to this graph, as of today, we are sitting at close to 8M shares completely locked away just from certain subs, which I'm not sure I'm allowed to mention here, so I won't, but lets be honest, you know what they are.

This, in addition to RC's 9,001,000 shares, insiders additional \~5,700,000 shares, Institutional ownership of \~10,000,000  shares, mutual funds owning \~8,000,000 shares, and ETFs holding \~6,700,000 shares, that leaves us with a mere \~28,282,228 shares remaining.

This math visualized:

This data as you can see above, is likely about 3-5% higher for DRS'd shares than reality based on GameStops own report, which is detailed on the graph figure above.

**I hit the picture limit of reddit apparently, if you were wondering, it's 20**

So, I'll describe the rest the best I can, on the open see, there are 600,000-ish active users on a good month, and 280,000 on a bad month.  This gives them a **$13 billion dollar evaluation**.  GameStop is entering that space, rapidly, and efficiently, with premier partners, and their primary goal, with RC at the helm, is to delight customers.

GameStop, according to the letter RC wrote to the Board of Directors directly details that they have **55 million active subscriptions to their PowerUps program**.  If even **1%** of those users opt to try the new marketplace that GameStop is building, then GameStop will be a massive force to be reckoned with, short squeeze or no short squeeze.

**I think there is a short squeeze on the table still**, with GameStop hitting it's **lowest point in nearly a year today**, tons of shares locked away, and **11.4M WSB subscribers**, all it would take to repeat January 28th, 2021, is about **2 shares each, or $260**.  I remember when I saw people buying them by the hundreds, and many of us buying them at twice that for a single share.  I'm sure you love a home run, but I love to knock it out of the park with full bases, which is what we're looking at.  As of today, GameStop publicly reports **13.4%** short interest, and VW had a squeeze in 2008 which made it the **MOST VALUABLE COMPANY IN THE WORLD** with only **12.8%** short interest.

So, from here, all I have left to say is see you on the moon when the tendiman comes.

I would also like to say, I have tried to use as many pictures as I can for easy processing, and I have tried to organize this the best I can, but it's a lot of data, and I'm 4 hours into this at the time of writing this, so I am sorry if it's a little messy sometimes.

I have some cash sitting in my bank ready to get some more as I try to time the dip, which I believe will be sometime between now, and the middle of Febuary, and with this cash, I plan to get some June 17th 130c, and 150c, and some shares with whatever is left.  I'll now explain why I'm going for June 130c's, 150c's, and why I am still bullish on GME in the medium term (6 months)

**DD Start:**

I'll start with the crayons, since that's what most of you will scroll to first anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

[Don't put too much weight into this, it's just a visual representation for me to reference timestamps on the graph as I explain where we've been, and where we're going.](https://preview.redd.it/gp5asx0n2y981.png?width=974&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78a7ab496fb5a3e71842663da36df89a8cc1a4f5)

My TA is worthless without some explanation, so I have tried to label things as clearly as I can, to make this as easy to digest as possible, no fiber necessary ;)

The orange boxes represent the historical price ranges in the Jan -&gt; July window over the last 3 years.

The flags indicate the first trading day of the year, and July 17th, for each trading window

The yellow line is kind of like a candle within the orange box which I use to gauge my own expectations when charting.  This is a personal strategy, has little to do with the overall DD, but helps keep a frame of reference IMO.

Then, finally, the red boxes which are numbered.  These will be used as reference points to talk about GME, and their actions, and market sentiment for those trading windows.

My analysis of a company comes from actions that a company is taking to position themselves for the future, not where they are positioned today.  After all, you make money when you're early, not when you're late, and we all know hard hard it can be to time the market, especially as options traders, it's a core element of what we do, or try to do.

**#1, 2019 In Review:**

Ahhhhh  yes, 2019, covid isn't here yet, the world is running as it was designed to, and GME is a dying brick and motor company being led by an experienced brick and motor CEO, and executives, trying to survive in the gaming industry, arguably, one of the most technologically adoptive industries in the market.  The CEO decided to direct the company into primary collectables, and used hardware, and disks.  Essentially, a death sentence for the company.  It's clearly on a downtrend, since the retail sentiment, along with the wall street sentiment is that the company won't survive for 5 more years.

* **Game sales are primary digital** at this point.
* GameStop **has sizable debt** at this point.
* Their revenues, and sales, are clearly, and **rapidly declining**.
* The **leadership** constantly shouting 'multi-channel e-commerce business' as if that means anything anymore.
* GameStop looks like it's on the fast track to zero, as it should be based on it's **future market positioning**, and **leadership**.

At this point, GME has been shorted into oblivion, both by wallstreet, and retail, it's just not looking good for the company, anyone here could agree with that, except for maybe DFV, and other early GME bulls, but even they'd say it's risky at this point, and it might not work out.

This is just used as an example to show where the company was 2 years ago, which has significant influence when you're trying to gauge how fast a company can turn around, and make shifts in an industry.  We'd all be able to agree that 2019 GME, and 2021 GME are different beasts, although, with some of the same existing problems, which I'll touch on later.

&amp;#x200B;

**#2 (part 1), The Burrrrrry Chapter**

This is an interesting one, since there is a pretty significant spike in the share price, followed by a meltdown to previous levels.  There wasn't any news regarding GME actions at this time, however, there was an activist hedge fund who was invested into the company at the time, Scion Capital, which is managed by Michael Burrrrrrry.  From here, things get interesting, I'll try to use as many pictures as I can to keep your attention.

Lets start with the SEC filing for the purchase Scion Capital made of 3.4 million GME shares.

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/0001649339\/000090514820000491\/efc20-335\_sc13d.htm ](https://preview.redd.it/hujye2if3y981.png?width=339&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68ebfa57e8e8c18a0af688fd8eb5b8e48844c210)

Then, prior to the filing, Mr. Burrrrry wrote a letter to the GameStop Board of Directors, which I **STRONGLY RECOMMEND** reading, sorry if the screenshots are too small, CBA to enlarge the page, source is included in the caption.

**Part 1:**

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 2:**

&amp;#x200B;

[Just goes to show the INSANE short conviction, which later detailed by the proof of naked shorts by the SEC is not shocking since the only way out is to admit to illegal activity for SHF, and market makers involved.](https://preview.redd.it/ltk4re5m3y981.png?width=697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33ec24a6a205a419a59cde870a39f666daa2e0c6)

As you can see by the dates I have highlighted above, Michael Burry suggested to GameStop that they are heavily, and unreasonably sold short, since they have more cash on-hand publicly than their company is even being valued at.  This is a huge red-flag for a term called '[death spiral financing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_spiral_financing)'.  Michael Burry caught it in the very early phases by pointing out that they had debt accruing, and enough money to pay it off, while also doing a share buyback, and expressed concern that the company leadership had chosen to not take that action yet.  He also suggested to combat the overwhelming short interest that was building on GME.  This is extremely evident looking back due to data given by the SEC GameStop investigation/report that was published (see image below), along with Michael Burrys own provided data in his letter.

This is a big part of what led to the **January 2021 sneeze**.

As you can see, the 13D filing Michael Burrrrry filed is dated 'April 2nd, 2019', which directly correlates to the graph, as the spike here starts on April 3rd, **the day after the letter was delivered to the GME leadership**, and brings the stock price from $2.67 at the low on April 9th, to the peak of $6.40 on April 14th.  This is the time-frame where Scion capital made it's GME purchase of 3.4 million shares.

&amp;#x200B;

**#2 (part 2) The Ryan Cohen Chapter (this happened between #2, and #3 on my graph)**

Quick backstory on RC before we move on:

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ryan\_Cohen ](https://preview.redd.it/tkpbuc4s2y981.png?width=2145&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c1929451cff13da12e1303068d3eb9044d061f7)

Long story short, he took a company from round 1 VC funding in 2013 @ 15 million, to selling the company in 2017 for $3.35 billion, which was the largest e-commerce acquisition of all time.  That's a 4 year timeline from nothing to billions.  Innovative, disruptive, and efficient.

Between #2, and #3 on my chart, RC made his initial purchases of GME shares, which he filed in his 13D filing of his investment company, RC Ventures LLC, which was a total of 5.8 million shares, pictured below.

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/fintel.io\/doc\/sec-gme-gamestop-rc-ventures-llc-sc-13d-2020-august-28-18502 \(scroll to bottom\)](https://preview.redd.it/w8eu9ddt2y981.png?width=1903&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5ba1f9e8845017ade3cf6de72cc361dedfb9e71)

RC made 6 purchases, the first being over 5% of the company, which required him to file a 13D, and the rest being adding to that position, which required a 13D/A, essentially adding to a position greater than 5% of the outstanding shares of a company, used for almost all hostile takeovers.  You will see the green boom boom candles between #2, and #3 directly correlate to the days that these filings are created.

&amp;#x200B;

[httpsL\/\/fintel.io\/if\/rc-ventures-llc](https://preview.redd.it/l79unusp3y981.png?width=1864&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c24aff60f6085ff245b32821faa75724ec3ef11)

RC wrote a letter to the GameStop Board of Directors as well, saying to follow a new direction of becoming a tech company, allowing digital trade-ins, and a customer first approach.  I **HIGHLY RECOMMEND** reading this, since it's from the single largest shareholder of GME since Jan 1st, 2021, a man who turned $15M into $3.35B in a mere 4 years.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**#3 The Sneeze, the Awakening, DFV, and You**

This is the part of the graph that I feel needs no explanation really, that is, if you were here a year ago.  We were jacked on Tesla, and GME.  DFV finally was popular after about a year of his bleeding calls posts, and was in the green, thanks to Michael Burry, Ryan Cohen, and his own understanding of where this company was going, and the relentless SI.

&amp;#x200B;

[The Roaring Kitty](https://preview.redd.it/0bef8zqq3y981.png?width=1283&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e26600e067e3e502dee663586ffca6c94dd58919)

We here, on WSB, love options plays, especially options plays that have a lot of research.  A lot of analytical background, and that were drawn up with crayons, and memes.

While #2 was happening, WSB was growing, and GME was one of the most talked about stocks, both in a positive, and negative lights here.  Lots of people got their stimulus checks, and also were on Reddit, and for some reason, those wonderful retards that WSB was a place for good investment advice, bless their souls, they didn't know better at the time, hell, some still don't.

WSB grew from 2 million users, to 10 million users in the time-span between #2, and #3.  If you were here for that, you know it was chaos, and you probably remember the talks of 'the end of the OG WSB'.  In a lot of ways, that was very accurate, and in other ways, it was less accurate, WSB has evolved, for sure, lots of meaningless DD flared posts, shills, and way more retards playing FD's than ever.  Just look at the TSLA posts this last week, and you'll see that there is still an embodiment of what WSB stands for.

I'm getting sentimental, so I'll leave it there, just know, I love you retards.

**Adding Up The Facts**

Michael Burry pointed out in his letter that there was an insane amount of SI, and that more shares were trading for GME at the time, than shares that should be possible to trade, IE, 'naked shorts'.  The SEC confirmed this for us earlier this year with their GameStop investigation:

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/files\/staff-report-equity-options-market-struction-conditions-early-2021.pdf ](https://preview.redd.it/20545ass3y981.png?width=569&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbdb4210c2853825f80d77c12441870af60de5df)

On December 31st, 2020, GME had more than 100% short interest confirmed by the SEC, AKA, naked shorts.  To clarify, this means that without a shadow of a doubt, not a \*\*NOT A SINGLE SHARE WAS AVAILABLE\*\* to be sold long on the day December 31st, 2020, in a fair, and free market.  The SEC also confirms in this investigation that the shorts didn't close during the January run-up, they diamond handed, and hoped for the best, a feeling many of us know all too well.

This now brings us to January 3rd, 2021, WSB is growing massively, most people just barely got their stimulus in the mail/direct deposited, and are ready to throw it into the wall street casino.  They do what the average retard would do, buy some shares, and OTM weeklies/monthlies based on DD that was posted by some internet stranger (this time it's me, what's up), and knowing that there are \*\*ZERO SHARES AVAILABLE FOR GME AS OF THE LAST FRIDAY\*\*,  this puts extreme pressure on brokers, since they can't locate the shares.  They can't internalize.  They are fucked, market makers are fucked, SHF are fucked, and the DTCC + NSCC are freaking out.  They internally agree to turn off the buy button across a series of clearing houses, which forces brokers to turn their buy buttons off.

RH got the wrist slap from this, but don't forget, Webull, Public, T212, and many others also turned the buy button off.  This is because they got direct orders from Apex Clearing that they cannot process buy orders.  This requires some of the small SHF to buy-back shares from us, WSB.  We gave them the biggest, dirtiest middle finger we could.  We essentially took down Melvin Capital, P72, Citron, and many others.

We were all fucked by the buy button being turned off, since the majority of us had calls, which expire worthless if not exercised, and not enough money to exercise.  Many made money, more lost money, SHF's got bailed out by Citadel, their market maker, and partner in crime, and supposedly, life was supposed to keep going as if nothing happened?

Fuck no, we diamond handed that shit, at least many of us did.  We had been talking on WSB about the possible squeeze for MONTHS.  We're not going out without a fight, we doubled the fuck down, tripled down, diamond handed, exercised OTM calls, and did everything we could to put as much pressure as we could on those that took everything from us in 2008, 1970, etc.  We finally had the ace, they were wrong, we won.

The NSCC, and DTCC waived all fees, and SHF, and Citadel created massive can kicked positions to deal with the volume that they didn't have on-hand.  They bent the rules, and tried to force us out.  Looking at the graph again, this is the best part.

**#3, and #4 We're Still Here, and The Shorts Are Still There:**

There's clearly apes here, GameStop sold 5m shares into the market to raise $1.7B  in cash, there's still practically no float (which we can prove without a doubt now, thanks to GameStop filing their latest quarterly report), and shorts still are in the play, naked, or not.  They stated that there was 5M shares registered with CS as of Oct. 30st, 2021.  This was over a quarter ago, and here is the data gathered by apes since then.

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.computershared.net ](https://preview.redd.it/505q558u3y981.png?width=2097&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87cbc508575c13fd4caa2cbc92a3b45367526d2d)

According to this graph, as of today, we are sitting at close to 8M shares completely locked away just from certain subs, which I'm not sure I'm allowed to mention here, so I won't, but lets be honest, you know what they are.

This, in addition to RC's 9,001,000 shares, insiders additional \~5,700,000 shares, Institutional ownership of \~10,000,000  shares, mutual funds owning \~8,000,000 shares, and ETFs holding \~6,700,000 shares, that leaves us with a mere \~28,282,228 shares remaining.

This math visualized:

This data as you can see above, is likely about 3-5% higher for DRS'd shares than reality based on GameStops own report, which is detailed on the graph figure above.

So, I'll describe the rest the best I can, on the open see, there are 600,000-ish active users on a good month, and 280,000 on a bad month.  This gives them a **$13 billion dollar evaluation**.

# Flashback - Christmas 2020

Let’s set the stage. Remember December 2020 ya’ll?

I sold 88,233 shares GME at $15.50 for some random dog toy in a box company. There were no apes yet, just Ryan Cohen buying more shares with hopes of a company turnaround. There were record COVID cases, vaccines were just approved, and there was even a British virus mutation on the way that turned out to be Delta!

# Arc of Blue Balls - Teasing little jack ($1.75M to $1.6M in 6 months)

## Chapter 1: The Squeeze

History was made in January 2021. Ryan Cohen joins the board on Jan 11. GME shoots +12% to $20 and then another +57% to $31. The media picks up the story and Elon Musk tweets “Gamestonk” and to the moon we go! Another +51% to $65. Then +92% to $150. And a deep fucking +135% to $347 before Vlad and the Hood ruined all the fun.

But we did it. History was made. The thesis was right. GME OGs are celebrating and drinking regal whiskey. Shorts got fucked and apes got born. WSB gains millions of normies. Financial world is never the same again.

And where am I? All-in CRSR with $1.7M and 1 share of GME I held on at a $20.81 cost basis. 

Lots of people have asked me about how I felt during this period, dealing with the FOMO or thinking about what could’ve been.

But the reality was: I was celebrating and dancing right alongside every single one of you GME winners. The thesis was right! This was an undervalued retail company that was way over-shorted.

Yes, I paper-handed in December and lost out on quick millions but that didn’t deter me to keep going. As a principle I don’t ever chase stocks so I let GME rocket however high it wanted to go and I just kept my eye on potential new plays. There’s always another play.

CRSR was bobbing up and down in a beautiful channel for most of Q1 until it wasn’t which made my Jan/Feb rather un-eventful merely breaking even.

## Chapter 2: RKT Up and Down

Huge short interest and a special dividend announcement in the 2/25 ER call seemed to awaken huge volume so I jumped on for the ride on 3/1 and it exploded 72% the next day gaining $1.2M overnight and bringing me to $2.9M! Almost a triple millionaire just like that.

Thinking these high volume squeeze plays usually go on for longer than a day, I held and it fell 33% immediately the next day losing me $1M. Let me tell you, **gaining a million and then losing it the very next day changes a man.**

As it rode the support line, I kept holding until the next 5/6 ER hoping that millennials are still in house-buying fever but that call gave conclusive evidence otherwise so I sold right after it dropped below support for a -19% loss.

## Chapter 3: Steel Gang

Next I decided to go all-in on CLF for the first time, an American steel company, thanks to one of the most well-researched theses I’ve ever read.

As you can see from my trading history above, CLF becomes my go-to safe haven for 2021 with 6 separate swings each netting decent % gains adding up to an amazing total $ gain.

But I’m a bit of a stock whore though as you’ll see, I love jumping around between different stocks trying to time the upswing. But CLF is like that dependable onii-chan you can return to after a good thrashing out in the harsh world and you need a good serving of humble pie.

# Arc of Erection - It’s squeezin’ season ($1.6M to $4.25M in 3 months)

Now it’s 6 months into the year and I was doing worse than the indexes! Little jack needed some more serious pumping. AMC had just christened a whole new cohort of apes, GME crossed $300 for the 3rd time, and it looked like squeezin’ season was upon us yet again.

## Chapter 4: Squeeze Trades

* **CLOV** \- 37% short interest and meme stocks were back in season so I left the safe embrace of steel to flirt with some squeezies. I finally stuck the multi-millionaire status going from $1.6M to $2.2M. Yes I sold a bit early and missed a giant squeeze on 6/8-6/9 which could’ve launched me to $5M+ but no point in having regrets, only learn from the mistakes
* **SOFI** \- Given this just deSPAC’d to the SOFI ticker, there was a tingle that said this ChamathSPAC might do something crazy too. I woke up and saw a 148% short interest while on the toilet and in a blur went all-in cause that was too good to be true. Turns out it was and my app had a data error (likely due to the ticker change) and I should’ve checked other sources and finished jacking off for that post-nut clarity before going all-in. Due to the 2-day good faith restriction in my 401k, had to wait 2 days until I could sell for a -8% loss
* **MVST** \- Adam Jonas gave this stock a $6 PT while at $8, the same guy who gave TSLA a $10 PT when it was at $200 pre-split. Because of lolz, I decided to inverse him and got my biggest % gain of 70% in only 5 trading days skyrocketing past $3M to $4.25M. And while I sold RKT too late and CLOV too early, this one I sold juuust right. That’s called learning folks

# Arc of Ascension - Rise to legend ($4.25M to $8M in 3 months)

[*Kenja-taimu*](https://www.jlect.com/entry/2891/kenjataimu-kenjataimu/) *(賢者タイム) - The post-orgasmic period when a man's thoughts are no longer impaired by his sexual drive; he is thus likened to a ""sage"" of clear mind. Literally ""sage time"".*

## Chapter 5: Luck or Skills?

* **PLTR** \- Jumped in right before 8/12 ER with a 0/5 ER track record on a hunch it’s been so disappointing in all aspects since Jan that any positivity in the ER should give it a nice bump. Got my first W thanks to strong commercial contracts growth and +13% in the bag.
* **SKLZ** \- Another big disappointment since Feb but seems to have bottomed out. Also because of Big. Buck. Hunter and the best [thesis](https://reddit.com/user/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/comments/pgpm33/do_i_have_to_post_every_day_yes_im_still_in_sklz/hbcxi1t/) I’ve ever written. Nothing majorly notable besides the thesis.
* **AMZN** \- Flight to safety after losing $400K thinking AMZN hadn’t moved much in 2021 but being a boomer was not much fun.
* **TMC** \- Major FOMO from missing out on Ironnet and OPAD’s deSPAC stock redemption gamma squeezes made me emotional. Mining special metals from the bottom of the ocean, sure why not? Well turns out it’s pretty [sketchy](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tmc-is-drowning-in-legal-woes-and-environmental-concerns-2021-10-25) so I’m glad I only threw $1M at it but still ate a -25% loss.

## Chapter 6: Plot Armor Fully Activated

* **CLF** \- It was so great to be back with steel gang after so many ins and outs just in time for 10/22 ER. I’ve never lost money with CLF and this time was no different. It was all up to LG to deliver and boy did he deliver with upgraded guidances and my 2nd ER win in a row. Getting on Twitch to hear the call live with steel gang is still one of my favorite memories. The [transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/22/cleveland-cliffs-clf-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/) is full of great quotes of LG demolishing analysts – “That's math lesson, not chemistry!” Officially a penta-millionaire with $5.7M.
* **TDOC** \- Time to go for the ER turkey with 3 Ws in a row. Went all-in on another decimated Aunt Cathy stock like PLTR with the hope that any positivity in the ER should give it a nice bump. On 10/27 after hours however, the stock drops -7% and little jack goes limp losing $400k. But the report looked… good? In a literal example of main character plot armor, the stock reverses in the morning and ends up +7% instead and little jack nuts to being a hexa-millionaire with $6.1M.

## Chapter 7: Big Fucking Climax

Thanks to /u/_beto619 for [pointing](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRaceTo10Million/comments/qhvelq/nabbed_the_6_with_new_ath_of_61m_im_a/hiym91u/) me in the direction of BiG Fucking Value, an undervalued sports retailer with a high short interest and earnings coming up. This play really had it all.

* Tossed in a million for the 11/2 ER thinking this could be like a CHGG or a CAR, literal coin flip. Turns out it was both, dropping 9% after hours but recovering by morning, just like TDOC, again with my plot armor at full power
* I decided to double down in the morning with another million and then tripled down and then said fuck it and went all in
* Found out the GME OGs including /u/Uberkikz11, /u/Jeffamazon, /u/FatAspirations, /u/CPTHubbard were all on top of this play as well and it felt like a reunion
* Created a Twitter account just to react live on a Twitter Spaces with Rod Alzmann aka Uberkikz11. Someone managed to record the last 25 minutes of it [here](https://youtu.be/ZsgJ1629eio)
* Crossed $7M, then $8M, and even $9M and touched $10m for a literal 2 minutes and all I got was this [screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/eo8acvyoxtz71.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9b6f9cf64871010dc3354879e891f77da79ee9c)
* Decided in a moment of post-nut [epiphany](https://www.reddit.com/user/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/comments/quradf/fin_35k_to_8m_228x_in_21_months_officially/hkrtri3/), that I’ve achieved my original goal of escaping from wage slavery and $8M is enough and I’m officially retiring

I'm sure I’ll hit the elusive 8 digits again some time in life, it’s only 25% away

I look forward to seeing her again

# Fin - Post-coitus retirement

[Final 21 month all-time chart from $35K to $8M \(228X\)](https://preview.redd.it/abpejhi4np781.jpg?width=1284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da34294a73720fc8cb4479d7d728f610f751c546)

## What's Next?

* Just got back from a lovely 18-day trip in Europe enjoying the delicious delicacies of being FATFIRE such as paying 30 euros for tiramisu to be brought up by room service at midnight and currently relaxing with family on a beautiful snowy mountain.
* My plan is to DCA into SPY/QQQ over the next few months as I have no idea which way the market will go. While it feels like I did time the top on many individual stocks by retiring on 11/15, SPY/QQQ is right back to where it was on 11/15. I’m still worried about the effects of tapering, interest rate increases, and potential lowered guidances in next round of ERs but the market also seems to be just as strong as ever so DCA seems like the best strategy here.
   * Why am I being so conservative all of a sudden? Honestly I’m just tired from trying to perfectly time everything. It’s stressful keeping up with all the news and you feel bad if you mis-timed it. I want to focus my time and energy on other things so DCA allows me to re-enter the market with less stress
* In the new year I plan to quit my job and focus on 3 things: my health, my house, and a special project. I want to live a long healthy life to enjoy this newfound generational wealth, buy all the fancy toys and do all the fancy renovations to live in a beautiful home, and build a product based on everything I’ve learned these past 2 years about personal finance and community for you guys. And no it’s not a paid newsletter or chat group or anything stupid like that. Stay tuned!

# Final Message for My Little Jacks

I really believe I just got very lucky.

* The initial $35K in my 401k was an accident. I actually wanted to take my annual Jan bonus in cash to buy some toys but missed the cutoff date to change it in Dec so it defaulted to throwing my annual bonus in my 401k
* Started trading in Feb 2020 as COVID created the most bi-polar volatile market ever swinging between covid and recovery stocks quickly growing $35k to $900k in 4 months, something that is irreproducible
* Continued trading as meme stocks and short squeezes shook the financial world before they re-tuned their algorithms and shortened their potency
* Literally got lucky on 4 coin-flip-type ERs in a row

Live to fight another day. If it’s good enough to screenshot, it’s good enough to sell. Don’t chase. Use independent thinking. It’s just money. 

All these sayings… all these lessons… at the end of this journey I’m still not sure what to make of it all. Life is short. Enjoy it as best you can. Try to do good. And try to be lucky.

I’ll still be around, probably not posting much but maybe some comments here and there.

It’s been an absolute **life changing** time with you all.

# Flashback - Christmas 2020

Let’s set the stage. Remember December 2020 ya’ll?

I sold 88,233 shares GME at $15.50 for some random dog toy in a box company. There were no apes yet, just Ryan Cohen buying more shares with hopes of a company turnaround. There were record COVID cases, vaccines were just approved, and there was even a British virus mutation on the way that turned out to be Delta!

# Arc of Blue Balls - Teasing little jack ($1.75M to $1.6M in 6 months)

## Chapter 1: The Squeeze

History was made in January 2021. Ryan Cohen joins the board on Jan 11. GME shoots +12% to $20 and then another +57% to $31. The media picks up the story and Elon Musk tweets “Gamestonk” and to the moon we go! Another +51% to $65. Then +92% to $150. And a deep fucking +135% to $347 before Vlad and the Hood ruined all the fun.

But we did it. History was made. The thesis was right. GME OGs are celebrating and drinking regal whiskey. Shorts got fucked and apes got born. WSB gains millions of normies. Financial world is never the same again.

And where am I? All-in CRSR with $1.7M and 1 share of GME I held on at a $20.81 cost basis. 

Lots of people have asked me about how I felt during this period, dealing with the FOMO or thinking about what could’ve been.

But the reality was: I was celebrating and dancing right alongside every single one of you GME winners. The thesis was right! This was an undervalued retail company that was way over-shorted.

Yes, I paper-handed in December and lost out on quick millions but that didn’t deter me to keep going. As a principle I don’t ever chase stocks so I let GME rocket however high it wanted to go and I just kept my eye on potential new plays. There’s always another play.

CRSR was bobbing up and down in a beautiful channel for most of Q1 until it wasn’t which made my Jan/Feb rather un-eventful merely breaking even.

## Chapter 2: RKT Up and Down

Huge short interest and a special dividend announcement in the 2/25 ER call seemed to awaken huge volume so I jumped on for the ride on 3/1 and it exploded 72% the next day gaining $1.2M overnight and bringing me to $2.9M! Almost a triple millionaire just like that.

Thinking these high volume squeeze plays usually go on for longer than a day, I held and it fell 33% immediately the next day losing me $1M. Let me tell you, **gaining a million and then losing it the very next day changes a man.**

As it rode the support line, I kept holding until the next 5/6 ER hoping that millennials are still in house-buying fever but that call gave conclusive evidence otherwise so I sold right after it dropped below support for a -19% loss.

## Chapter 3: Steel Gang

Next I decided to go all-in on CLF for the first time, an American steel company, thanks to one of the most well-researched theses I’ve ever read.

As you can see from my trading history above, CLF becomes my go-to safe haven for 2021 with 6 separate swings each netting decent % gains adding up to an amazing total $ gain.

But I’m a bit of a stock whore though as you’ll see, I love jumping around between different stocks trying to time the upswing. But CLF is like that dependable onii-chan you can return to after a good thrashing out in the harsh world and you need a good serving of humble pie.

# Arc of Erection - It’s squeezin’ season ($1.6M to $4.25M in 3 months)

Now it’s 6 months into the year and I was doing worse than the indexes! Little jack needed some more serious pumping. AMC had just christened a whole new cohort of apes, GME crossed $300 for the 3rd time, and it looked like squeezin’ season was upon us yet again.

## Chapter 4: Squeeze Trades

* **CLOV** \- 37% short interest and meme stocks were back in season so I left the safe embrace of steel to flirt with some squeezies. I finally stuck the multi-millionaire status going from $1.6M to $2.2M. Yes I sold a bit early and missed a giant squeeze on 6/8-6/9 which could’ve launched me to $5M+ but no point in having regrets, only learn from the mistakes
* **SOFI** \- Given this just deSPAC’d to the SOFI ticker, there was a tingle that said this ChamathSPAC might do something crazy too. I woke up and saw a 148% short interest while on the toilet and in a blur went all-in cause that was too good to be true. Turns out it was and my app had a data error (likely due to the ticker change) and I should’ve checked other sources and finished jacking off for that post-nut clarity before going all-in. Due to the 2-day good faith restriction in my 401k, had to wait 2 days until I could sell for a -8% loss
* **MVST** \- Adam Jonas gave this stock a $6 PT while at $8, the same guy who gave TSLA a $10 PT when it was at $200 pre-split. Because of lolz, I decided to inverse him and got my biggest % gain of 70% in only 5 trading days skyrocketing past $3M to $4.25M. And while I sold RKT too late and CLOV too early, this one I sold juuust right. That’s called learning folks

# Arc of Ascension - Rise to legend ($4.25M to $8M in 3 months)

[*Kenja-taimu*](https://www.jlect.com/entry/2891/kenjataimu-kenjataimu/) *(賢者タイム) - The post-orgasmic period when a man's thoughts are no longer impaired by his sexual drive; he is thus likened to a ""sage"" of clear mind. Literally ""sage time"".*

## Chapter 5: Luck or Skills?

* **PLTR** \- Jumped in right before 8/12 ER with a 0/5 ER track record on a hunch it’s been so disappointing in all aspects since Jan that any positivity in the ER should give it a nice bump. Got my first W thanks to strong commercial contracts growth and +13% in the bag.
* **SKLZ** \- Another big disappointment since Feb but seems to have bottomed out. Also because of Big. Buck. Hunter and the best [thesis](https://reddit.com/user/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/comments/pgpm33/do_i_have_to_post_every_day_yes_im_still_in_sklz/hbcxi1t/) I’ve ever written. Nothing majorly notable besides the thesis.
* **AMZN** \- Flight to safety after losing $400K thinking AMZN hadn’t moved much in 2021 but being a boomer was not much fun.
* **TMC** \- Major FOMO from missing out on Ironnet and OPAD’s deSPAC stock redemption gamma squeezes made me emotional. Mining special metals from the bottom of the ocean, sure why not? Well turns out it’s pretty [sketchy](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tmc-is-drowning-in-legal-woes-and-environmental-concerns-2021-10-25) so I’m glad I only threw $1M at it but still ate a -25% loss.

## Chapter 6: Plot Armor Fully Activated

* **CLF** \- It was so great to be back with steel gang after so many ins and outs just in time for 10/22 ER. I’ve never lost money with CLF and this time was no different. It was all up to LG to deliver and boy did he deliver with upgraded guidances and my 2nd ER win in a row. Getting on Twitch to hear the call live with steel gang is still one of my favorite memories. The [transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/22/cleveland-cliffs-clf-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/) is full of great quotes of LG demolishing analysts – “That's math lesson, not chemistry!” Officially a penta-millionaire with $5.7M.
* **TDOC** \- Time to go for the ER turkey with 3 Ws in a row. Went all-in on another decimated Aunt Cathy stock like PLTR with the hope that any positivity in the ER should give it a nice bump. On 10/27 after hours however, the stock drops -7% and little jack goes limp losing $400k. But the report looked… good? In a literal example of main character plot armor, the stock reverses in the morning and ends up +7% instead and little jack nuts to being a hexa-millionaire with $6.1M.

## Chapter 7: Big Fucking Climax

Thanks to /u/_beto619 for [pointing](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRaceTo10Million/comments/qhvelq/nabbed_the_6_with_new_ath_of_61m_im_a/hiym91u/) me in the direction of BiG Fucking Value, an undervalued sports retailer with a high short interest and earnings coming up. This play really had it all.

* Tossed in a million for the 11/2 ER thinking this could be like a CHGG or a CAR, literal coin flip. Turns out it was both, dropping 9% after hours but recovering by morning, just like TDOC, again with my plot armor at full power
* I decided to double down in the morning with another million and then tripled down and then said fuck it and went all in
* Found out the GME OGs including /u/Uberkikz11, /u/Jeffamazon, /u/FatAspirations, /u/CPTHubbard were all on top of this play as well and it felt like a reunion
* Created a Twitter account just to react live on a Twitter Spaces with Rod Alzmann aka Uberkikz11. Someone managed to record the last 25 minutes of it [here](https://youtu.be/ZsgJ1629eio)
* Crossed $7M, then $8M, and even $9M and touched $10m for a literal 2 minutes and all I got was this [screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/eo8acvyoxtz71.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9b6f9cf64871010dc3354879e891f77da79ee9c)
* Decided in a moment of post-nut [epiphany](https://www.reddit.com/user/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/comments/quradf/fin_35k_to_8m_228x_in_21_months_officially/hkrtri3/), that I’ve achieved my original goal of escaping from wage slavery and $8M is enough and I’m officially retiring

I'm sure I’ll hit the elusive 8 digits again some time in life, it’s only 25% away

I look forward to seeing her again

# Fin - Post-coitus retirement

[Final 21 month all-time chart from $35K to $8M \(228X\)](https://preview.redd.it/abpejhi4np781.jpg?width=1284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da34294a73720fc8cb4479d7d728f610f751c546)

## What's Next?

* Just got back from a lovely 18-day trip in Europe enjoying the delicious delicacies of being FATFIRE such as paying 30 euros for tiramisu to be brought up by room service at midnight and currently relaxing with family on a beautiful snowy mountain.
* My plan is to DCA into SPY/QQQ over the next few months as I have no idea which way the market will go. While it feels like I did time the top on many individual stocks by retiring on 11/15, SPY/QQQ is right back to where it was on 11/15. I’m still worried about the effects of tapering, interest rate increases, and potential lowered guidances in next round of ERs but the market also seems to be just as strong as ever so DCA seems like the best strategy here.
   * Why am I being so conservative all of a sudden? Honestly I’m just tired from trying to perfectly time everything. It’s stressful keeping up with all the news and you feel bad if you mis-timed it. I want to focus my time and energy on other things so DCA allows me to re-enter the market with less stress
* In the new year I plan to quit my job and focus on 3 things: my health, my house, and a special project. I want to live a long healthy life to enjoy this newfound generational wealth, buy all the fancy toys and do all the fancy renovations to live in a beautiful home, and build a product based on everything I’ve learned these past 2 years about personal finance and community for you guys. And no it’s not a paid newsletter or chat group or anything stupid like that. Stay tuned!

## Shoutouts

* Lots of redditors who kept me thoroughly entertained over the year - /u/dong_opus, /u/CreepingFog, /u/platypus55, /u/alifeofataraxia, /u/lavenderviking, /u/raptors-2020, /u/Green_Lantern_4vr and many more
* GME OGs are the real deal, love you guys - /u/Uberkikz11, /u/Jeffamazon, /u/FatAspirations, /u/CPTHubbard 
* What’s a good race without some rivals? Along the way I met some fellow wage slaves all yolo-ing their way to 8 digits in their own ways that I’m proud to call my rivals in the greatest reality show of our times - /u/irishdud1, /u/401kdaytrade, /u/caddude42069, /u/Noah_Deez_Nutz \- ya’ll are goats in your own special ways. Really special ways.
* /u/IKnowTheCodings for un-knowingly challenging my ego with his [gains post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/grap5c/4_years_of_gains/) 2 years ago leading me to start posting and addicted to the titillation of internet points

## Trade Setup

* Ever single trade was done on my iPhone 7 Plus with the TD Ameritrade app. Usually on my Toto toilet. I use Webull desktop client and TradingView website for watching charts and technical analysis during the day on a second monitor separate from my work setup
   * I’ve since upgraded to the iPhone 13 Pro Max

# Final Message for My Little Jacks

I really believe I just got very lucky.

* The initial $35K in my 401k was an accident. I actually wanted to take my annual Jan bonus in cash to buy some toys but missed the cutoff date to change it in Dec so it defaulted to throwing my annual bonus in my 401k
* Started trading in Feb 2020 as COVID created the most bi-polar volatile market ever swinging between covid and recovery stocks quickly growing $35k to $900k in 4 months, something that is irreproducible
* Continued trading as meme stocks and short squeezes shook the financial world before they re-tuned their algorithms and shortened their potency
* Literally got lucky on 4 coin-flip-type ERs in a row

Live to fight another day. If it’s good enough to screenshot, it’s good enough to sell. Don’t chase. Use independent thinking. It’s just money. 

All these sayings… all these lessons… at the end of this journey I’m still not sure what to make of it all. Life is short. Enjoy it as best you can. Try to do good. And try to be lucky.

I’ll still be around, probably not posting much but maybe some comments here and there.

It’s been an absolute **life changing** time with you all.

Gather 'round again fellow retards and autists. SIR JACK A LOT is back with a sequel to last year’s [Magnum Dong Opus](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kjyzh7/a_sir_jack_a_lot_christmas_carol_my_magnum_dong/) on turning $35K to $1.75M (50X) in 2020 by going all-in on a single stock all-shares.

In this post I share my journey from $1.75M to $8M in 2021 and announce my official retirement from trading. Read on for receipts and an epic tale of blue balls to hard-on erection and a climactic finale.

My secret? Post-nut clarity.

# Flashback - Christmas 2020

Let’s set the stage. Remember December 2020 ya’ll?

I sold 88,233 shares GME at $15.50 for some random dog toy in a box company. There were no apes yet, just Ryan Cohen buying more shares with hopes of a company turnaround. There were record COVID cases, vaccines were just approved, and there was even a British virus mutation on the way that turned out to be Delta!

# Arc of Blue Balls - Teasing little jack ($1.75M to $1.6M in 6 months)

## Chapter 1: The Squeeze

History was made in January 2021. Ryan Cohen joins the board on Jan 11. GME shoots +12% to $20 and then another +57% to $31. The media picks up the story and Elon Musk tweets “Gamestonk” and to the moon we go! Another +51% to $65. Then +92% to $150. And a deep fucking +135% to $347 before Vlad and the Hood ruined all the fun.

But we did it. History was made. The thesis was right. GME OGs are celebrating and drinking regal whiskey. Shorts got fucked and apes got born. WSB gains millions of normies. Financial world is never the same again.

And where am I? All-in CRSR with $1.7M and 1 share of GME I held on at a $20.81 cost basis. 

Lots of people have asked me about how I felt during this period, dealing with the FOMO or thinking about what could’ve been.

But the reality was: I was celebrating and dancing right alongside every single one of you GME winners. The thesis was right! This was an undervalued retail company that was way over-shorted.

Yes, I paper-handed in December and lost out on quick millions but that didn’t deter me to keep going. As a principle I don’t ever chase stocks so I let GME rocket however high it wanted to go and I just kept my eye on potential new plays. There’s always another play.

CRSR was bobbing up and down in a beautiful channel for most of Q1 until it wasn’t which made my Jan/Feb rather un-eventful merely breaking even.

## Chapter 2: RKT Up and Down

Huge short interest and a special dividend announcement in the 2/25 ER call seemed to awaken huge volume so I jumped on for the ride on 3/1 and it exploded 72% the next day gaining $1.2M overnight and bringing me to $2.9M! Almost a triple millionaire just like that.

Thinking these high volume squeeze plays usually go on for longer than a day, I held and it fell 33% immediately the next day losing me $1M. Let me tell you, **gaining a million and then losing it the very next day changes a man.**

As it rode the support line, I kept holding until the next 5/6 ER hoping that millennials are still in house-buying fever but that call gave conclusive evidence otherwise so I sold right after it dropped below support for a -19% loss.

## Chapter 3: Steel Gang

Next I decided to go all-in on CLF for the first time, an American steel company, thanks to one of the most well-researched theses I’ve ever read.

As you can see from my trading history above, CLF becomes my go-to safe haven for 2021 with 6 separate swings each netting decent % gains adding up to an amazing total $ gain.

But I’m a bit of a stock whore though as you’ll see, I love jumping around between different stocks trying to time the upswing. But CLF is like that dependable onii-chan you can return to after a good thrashing out in the harsh world and you need a good serving of humble pie.

# Arc of Erection - It’s squeezin’ season ($1.6M to $4.25M in 3 months)

Now it’s 6 months into the year and I was doing worse than the indexes! Little jack needed some more serious pumping. AMC had just christened a whole new cohort of apes, GME crossed $300 for the 3rd time, and it looked like squeezin’ season was upon us yet again.

## Chapter 4: Squeeze Trades

* **CLOV** \- 37% short interest and meme stocks were back in season so I left the safe embrace of steel to flirt with some squeezies. I finally stuck the multi-millionaire status going from $1.6M to $2.2M. Yes I sold a bit early and missed a giant squeeze on 6/8-6/9 which could’ve launched me to $5M+ but no point in having regrets, only learn from the mistakes
* **SOFI** \- Given this just deSPAC’d to the SOFI ticker, there was a tingle that said this ChamathSPAC might do something crazy too. I woke up and saw a 148% short interest while on the toilet and in a blur went all-in cause that was too good to be true. Turns out it was and my app had a data error (likely due to the ticker change) and I should’ve checked other sources and finished jacking off for that post-nut clarity before going all-in. Due to the 2-day good faith restriction in my 401k, had to wait 2 days until I could sell for a -8% loss
* **MVST** \- Adam Jonas gave this stock a $6 PT while at $8, the same guy who gave TSLA a $10 PT when it was at $200 pre-split. Because of lolz, I decided to inverse him and got my biggest % gain of 70% in only 5 trading days skyrocketing past $3M to $4.25M. And while I sold RKT too late and CLOV too early, this one I sold juuust right. That’s called learning folks

# Arc of Ascension - Rise to legend ($4.25M to $8M in 3 months)

[*Kenja-taimu*](https://www.jlect.com/entry/2891/kenjataimu-kenjataimu/) *(賢者タイム) - The post-orgasmic period when a man's thoughts are no longer impaired by his sexual drive; he is thus likened to a ""sage"" of clear mind. Literally ""sage time"".*

## Chapter 5: Luck or Skills?

* **PLTR** \- Jumped in right before 8/12 ER with a 0/5 ER track record on a hunch it’s been so disappointing in all aspects since Jan that any positivity in the ER should give it a nice bump. Got my first W thanks to strong commercial contracts growth and +13% in the bag.
* **SKLZ** \- Another big disappointment since Feb but seems to have bottomed out. Also because of Big. Buck. Hunter and the best [thesis](https://reddit.com/user/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/comments/pgpm33/do_i_have_to_post_every_day_yes_im_still_in_sklz/hbcxi1t/) I’ve ever written. Nothing majorly notable besides the thesis.
* **AMZN** \- Flight to safety after losing $400K thinking AMZN hadn’t moved much in 2021 but being a boomer was not much fun.
* **TMC** \- Major FOMO from missing out on Ironnet and OPAD’s deSPAC stock redemption gamma squeezes made me emotional. Mining special metals from the bottom of the ocean, sure why not? Well turns out it’s pretty [sketchy](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tmc-is-drowning-in-legal-woes-and-environmental-concerns-2021-10-25) so I’m glad I only threw $1M at it but still ate a -25% loss.

## Chapter 6: Plot Armor Fully Activated

* **CLF** \- It was so great to be back with steel gang after so many ins and outs just in time for 10/22 ER. I’ve never lost money with CLF and this time was no different. It was all up to LG to deliver and boy did he deliver with upgraded guidances and my 2nd ER win in a row. Getting on Twitch to hear the call live with steel gang is still one of my favorite memories. The [transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/22/cleveland-cliffs-clf-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/) is full of great quotes of LG demolishing analysts – “That's math lesson, not chemistry!” Officially a penta-millionaire with $5.7M.
* **TDOC** \- Time to go for the ER turkey with 3 Ws in a row. Went all-in on another decimated Aunt Cathy stock like PLTR with the hope that any positivity in the ER should give it a nice bump. On 10/27 after hours however, the stock drops -7% and little jack goes limp losing $400k. But the report looked… good? In a literal example of main character plot armor, the stock reverses in the morning and ends up +7% instead and little jack nuts to being a hexa-millionaire with $6.1M.

## Chapter 7: Big Fucking Climax

Thanks to /u/_beto619 for [pointing](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRaceTo10Million/comments/qhvelq/nabbed_the_6_with_new_ath_of_61m_im_a/hiym91u/) me in the direction of BiG Fucking Value, an undervalued sports retailer with a high short interest and earnings coming up. This play really had it all.

* Tossed in a million for the 11/2 ER thinking this could be like a CHGG or a CAR, literal coin flip. Turns out it was both, dropping 9% after hours but recovering by morning, just like TDOC, again with my plot armor at full power
* I decided to double down in the morning with another million and then tripled down and then said fuck it and went all in
* Found out the GME OGs including /u/Uberkikz11, /u/Jeffamazon, /u/FatAspirations, /u/CPTHubbard were all on top of this play as well and it felt like a reunion
* Created a Twitter account just to react live on a Twitter Spaces with Rod Alzmann aka Uberkikz11. Someone managed to record the last 25 minutes of it [here](https://youtu.be/ZsgJ1629eio)
* Crossed $7M, then $8M, and even $9M and touched $10m for a literal 2 minutes and all I got was this [screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/eo8acvyoxtz71.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9b6f9cf64871010dc3354879e891f77da79ee9c)
* Decided in a moment of post-nut [epiphany](https://www.reddit.com/user/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/comments/quradf/fin_35k_to_8m_228x_in_21_months_officially/hkrtri3/), that I’ve achieved my original goal of escaping from wage slavery and $8M is enough and I’m officially retiring

I'm sure I’ll hit the elusive 8 digits again some time in life, it’s only 25% away

I look forward to seeing her again

# Fin - Post-coitus retirement

[Final 21 month all-time chart from $35K to $8M \(228X\)](https://preview.redd.it/szw72ysilp781.jpg?width=1284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9db21b2782999aa3370c67431379db4e31f69668)

## What's Next?

* Just got back from a lovely 18-day trip in Europe enjoying the delicious delicacies of being FATFIRE such as paying 30 euros for tiramisu to be brought up by room service at midnight and currently relaxing with family on a beautiful snowy mountain.
* My plan is to DCA into SPY/QQQ over the next few months as I have no idea which way the market will go. While it feels like I did time the top on many individual stocks by retiring on 11/15, SPY/QQQ is right back to where it was on 11/15. I’m still worried about the effects of tapering, interest rate increases, and potential lowered guidances in next round of ERs but the market also seems to be just as strong as ever so DCA seems like the best strategy here.
   * Why am I being so conservative all of a sudden? Honestly I’m just tired from trying to perfectly time everything. It’s stressful keeping up with all the news and you feel bad if you mis-timed it. I want to focus my time and energy on other things so DCA allows me to re-enter the market with less stress
* In the new year I plan to quit my job and focus on 3 things: my health, my house, and a special project. I want to live a long healthy life to enjoy this newfound generational wealth, buy all the fancy toys and do all the fancy renovations to live in a beautiful home, and build a product based on everything I’ve learned these past 2 years about personal finance and community for you guys. And no it’s not a paid newsletter or chat group or anything stupid like that. Stay tuned!

# Final Message for My Little Jacks

I really believe I just got very lucky.

* The initial $35K in my 401k was an accident. I actually wanted to take my annual Jan bonus in cash to buy some toys but missed the cutoff date to change it in Dec so it defaulted to throwing my annual bonus in my 401k
* Started trading in Feb 2020 as COVID created the most bi-polar volatile market ever swinging between covid and recovery stocks quickly growing $35k to $900k in 4 months, something that is irreproducible
* Continued trading as meme stocks and short squeezes shook the financial world before they re-tuned their algorithms and shortened their potency
* Literally got lucky on 4 coin-flip-type ERs in a row

Live to fight another day. If it’s good enough to screenshot, it’s good enough to sell. Don’t chase. Use independent thinking. It’s just money. 

All these sayings… all these lessons… at the end of this journey I’m still not sure what to make of it all. Life is short. Enjoy it as best you can. Try to do good. And try to be lucky.

I’ll still be around, probably not posting much but maybe some comments here and there.

It’s been an absolute **life changing** time with you all.

# Flashback - Christmas 2020

Let’s set the stage. Remember December 2020 ya’ll?

I sold 88,233 shares GME at $15.50 for some random dog toy in a box company. There were no apes yet, just Ryan Cohen buying more shares with hopes of a company turnaround. There were record COVID cases, vaccines were just approved, and there was even a British virus mutation on the way that turned out to be Delta!

# Arc of Blue Balls - Teasing little jack ($1.75M to $1.6M in 6 months)

## Chapter 1: The Squeeze

History was made in January 2021. Ryan Cohen joins the board on Jan 11. GME shoots +12% to $20 and then another +57% to $31. The media picks up the story and Elon Musk tweets “Gamestonk” and to the moon we go! Another +51% to $65. Then +92% to $150. And a deep fucking +135% to $347 before Vlad and the Hood ruined all the fun.

But we did it. History was made. The thesis was right. GME OGs are celebrating and drinking regal whiskey. Shorts got fucked and apes got born. WSB gains millions of normies. Financial world is never the same again.

And where am I? All-in CRSR with $1.7M and 1 share of GME I held on at a $20.81 cost basis. 

Lots of people have asked me about how I felt during this period, dealing with the FOMO or thinking about what could’ve been.

But the reality was: I was celebrating and dancing right alongside every single one of you GME winners. The thesis was right! This was an undervalued retail company that was way over-shorted.

Yes, I paper-handed in December and lost out on quick millions but that didn’t deter me to keep going. As a principle I don’t ever chase stocks so I let GME rocket however high it wanted to go and I just kept my eye on potential new plays. There’s always another play.

CRSR was bobbing up and down in a beautiful channel for most of Q1 until it wasn’t which made my Jan/Feb rather un-eventful merely breaking even.

## Chapter 2: RKT Up and Down

Huge short interest and a special dividend announcement in the 2/25 ER call seemed to awaken huge volume so I jumped on for the ride on 3/1 and it exploded 72% the next day gaining $1.2M overnight and bringing me to $2.9M! Almost a triple millionaire just like that.

Thinking these high volume squeeze plays usually go on for longer than a day, I held and it fell 33% immediately the next day losing me $1M. Let me tell you, **gaining a million and then losing it the very next day changes a man.**

As it rode the support line, I kept holding until the next 5/6 ER hoping that millennials are still in house-buying fever but that call gave conclusive evidence otherwise so I sold right after it dropped below support for a -19% loss.

## Chapter 3: Steel Gang

Next I decided to go all-in on CLF for the first time, an American steel company, thanks to one of the most well-researched theses I’ve ever read.

As you can see from my trading history above, CLF becomes my go-to safe haven for 2021 with 6 separate swings each netting decent % gains adding up to an amazing total $ gain.

But I’m a bit of a stock whore though as you’ll see, I love jumping around between different stocks trying to time the upswing. But CLF is like that dependable onii-chan you can return to after a good thrashing out in the harsh world and you need a good serving of humble pie.

# Arc of Erection - It’s squeezin’ season ($1.6M to $4.25M in 3 months)

Now it’s 6 months into the year and I was doing worse than the indexes! Little jack needed some more serious pumping. AMC had just christened a whole new cohort of apes, GME crossed $300 for the 3rd time, and it looked like squeezin’ season was upon us yet again.

## Chapter 4: Squeeze Trades

* **CLOV** \- 37% short interest and meme stocks were back in season so I left the safe embrace of steel to flirt with some squeezies. I finally stuck the multi-millionaire status going from $1.6M to $2.2M. Yes I sold a bit early and missed a giant squeeze on 6/8-6/9 which could’ve launched me to $5M+ but no point in having regrets, only learn from the mistakes
* **SOFI** \- Given this just deSPAC’d to the SOFI ticker, there was a tingle that said this ChamathSPAC might do something crazy too. I woke up and saw a 148% short interest while on the toilet and in a blur went all-in cause that was too good to be true. Turns out it was and my app had a data error (likely due to the ticker change) and I should’ve checked other sources and finished jacking off for that post-nut clarity before going all-in. Due to the 2-day good faith restriction in my 401k, had to wait 2 days until I could sell for a -8% loss
* **MVST** \- Adam Jonas gave this stock a $6 PT while at $8, the same guy who gave TSLA a $10 PT when it was at $200 pre-split. Because of lolz, I decided to inverse him and got my biggest % gain of 70% in only 5 trading days skyrocketing past $3M to $4.25M. And while I sold RKT too late and CLOV too early, this one I sold juuust right. That’s called learning folks

# Arc of Ascension - Rise to legend ($4.25M to $8M in 3 months)

[*Kenja-taimu*](https://www.jlect.com/entry/2891/kenjataimu-kenjataimu/) *(賢者タイム) - The post-orgasmic period when a man's thoughts are no longer impaired by his sexual drive; he is thus likened to a ""sage"" of clear mind. Literally ""sage time"".*

## Chapter 5: Luck or Skills?

* **PLTR** \- Jumped in right before 8/12 ER with a 0/5 ER track record on a hunch it’s been so disappointing in all aspects since Jan that any positivity in the ER should give it a nice bump. Got my first W thanks to strong commercial contracts growth and +13% in the bag.
* **SKLZ** \- Another big disappointment since Feb but seems to have bottomed out. Also because of Big. Buck. Hunter and the best [thesis](https://reddit.com/user/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/comments/pgpm33/do_i_have_to_post_every_day_yes_im_still_in_sklz/hbcxi1t/) I’ve ever written. Nothing majorly notable besides the thesis.
* **AMZN** \- Flight to safety after losing $400K thinking AMZN hadn’t moved much in 2021 but being a boomer was not much fun.
* **TMC** \- Major FOMO from missing out on Ironnet and OPAD’s deSPAC stock redemption gamma squeezes made me emotional. Mining special metals from the bottom of the ocean, sure why not? Well turns out it’s pretty [sketchy](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tmc-is-drowning-in-legal-woes-and-environmental-concerns-2021-10-25) so I’m glad I only threw $1M at it but still ate a -25% loss.

## Chapter 6: Plot Armor Fully Activated

* **CLF** \- It was so great to be back with steel gang after so many ins and outs just in time for 10/22 ER. I’ve never lost money with CLF and this time was no different. It was all up to LG to deliver and boy did he deliver with upgraded guidances and my 2nd ER win in a row. Getting on Twitch to hear the call live with steel gang is still one of my favorite memories. The [transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/22/cleveland-cliffs-clf-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/) is full of great quotes of LG demolishing analysts – “That's math lesson, not chemistry!” Officially a penta-millionaire with $5.7M.
* **TDOC** \- Time to go for the ER turkey with 3 Ws in a row. Went all-in on another decimated Aunt Cathy stock like PLTR with the hope that any positivity in the ER should give it a nice bump. On 10/27 after hours however, the stock drops -7% and little jack goes limp losing $400k. But the report looked… good? In a literal example of main character plot armor, the stock reverses in the morning and ends up +7% instead and little jack nuts to being a hexa-millionaire with $6.1M.

## Chapter 7: Big Fucking Climax

Thanks to /u/_beto619 for [pointing](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRaceTo10Million/comments/qhvelq/nabbed_the_6_with_new_ath_of_61m_im_a/hiym91u/) me in the direction of BiG Fucking Value, an undervalued sports retailer with a high short interest and earnings coming up. This play really had it all.

* Tossed in a million for the 11/2 ER thinking this could be like a CHGG or a CAR, literal coin flip. Turns out it was both, dropping 9% after hours but recovering by morning, just like TDOC, again with my plot armor at full power
* I decided to double down in the morning with another million and then tripled down and then said fuck it and went all in
* Found out the GME OGs including /u/Uberkikz11, /u/Jeffamazon, /u/FatAspirations, /u/CPTHubbard were all on top of this play as well and it felt like a reunion
* Created a Twitter account just to react live on a Twitter Spaces with Rod Alzmann aka Uberkikz11. Someone managed to record the last 25 minutes of it [here](https://youtu.be/ZsgJ1629eio)
* Crossed $7M, then $8M, and even $9M and touched $10m for a literal 2 minutes and all I got was this [screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/eo8acvyoxtz71.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9b6f9cf64871010dc3354879e891f77da79ee9c)
* Decided in a moment of post-nut [epiphany](https://www.reddit.com/user/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/comments/quradf/fin_35k_to_8m_228x_in_21_months_officially/hkrtri3/), that I’ve achieved my original goal of escaping from wage slavery and $8M is enough and I’m officially retiring

I'm sure I’ll hit the elusive 8 digits again some time in life, it’s only 25% away

I look forward to seeing her again

## What's Next?

* Just got back from a lovely 18-day trip in Europe enjoying the delicious delicacies of being FATFIRE such as paying 30 euros for tiramisu to be brought up by room service at midnight and currently relaxing with family on a beautiful snowy mountain.
* My plan is to DCA into SPY/QQQ over the next few months as I have no idea which way the market will go. While it feels like I did time the top on many individual stocks by retiring on 11/15, SPY/QQQ is right back to where it was on 11/15. I’m still worried about the effects of tapering, interest rate increases, and potential lowered guidances in next round of ERs but the market also seems to be just as strong as ever so DCA seems like the best strategy here.
   * Why am I being so conservative all of a sudden? Honestly I’m just tired from trying to perfectly time everything. It’s stressful keeping up with all the news and you feel bad if you mis-timed it. I want to focus my time and energy on other things so DCA allows me to re-enter the market with less stress
* In the new year I plan to quit my job and focus on 3 things: my health, my house, and a special project. I want to live a long healthy life to enjoy this newfound generational wealth, buy all the fancy toys and do all the fancy renovations to live in a beautiful home, and build a product based on everything I’ve learned these past 2 years about personal finance and community for you guys. And no it’s not a paid newsletter or chat group or anything stupid like that. Stay tuned!

# Final Message for My Little Jacks

I really believe I just got very lucky.

* The initial $35K in my 401k was an accident. I actually wanted to take my annual Jan bonus in cash to buy some toys but missed the cutoff date to change it in Dec so it defaulted to throwing my annual bonus in my 401k
* Started trading in Feb 2020 as COVID created the most bi-polar volatile market ever swinging between covid and recovery stocks quickly growing $35k to $900k in 4 months, something that is irreproducible
* Continued trading as meme stocks and short squeezes shook the financial world before they re-tuned their algorithms and shortened their potency
* Literally got lucky on 4 coin-flip-type ERs in a row

Live to fight another day. If it’s good enough to screenshot, it’s good enough to sell. Don’t chase. Use independent thinking. It’s just money. 

All these sayings… all these lessons… at the end of this journey I’m still not sure what to make of it all. Life is short. Enjoy it as best you can. Try to do good. And try to be lucky.

I’ll still be around, probably not posting much but maybe some comments here and there.

It’s been an absolute **life changing** time with you all.

Gather 'round again fellow retards and autists. SIR JACK A LOT is back with a sequel to last year’s [Magnum Dong Opus](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kjyzh7/a_sir_jack_a_lot_christmas_carol_my_magnum_dong/) on turning $35K to $1.75M (50X) in 2020 by going all-in on a single stock all-shares.

In this post I share my journey from $1.75M to $8M in 2021 and announce my official retirement from trading. Read on for receipts and an epic tale of blue balls to hard-on erection and a climactic finale.

My secret? Post-nut clarity.

# Flashback - Christmas 2020

Let’s set the stage. Remember December 2020 ya’ll?

I sold 88,233 shares GME at $15.50 for some random dog toy in a box company. There were no apes yet, just Ryan Cohen buying more shares with hopes of a company turnaround. There were record COVID cases, vaccines were just approved, and there was even a British virus mutation on the way that turned out to be Delta!

# Arc of Blue Balls - Teasing little jack ($1.75M to $1.6M in 6 months)

## Chapter 1: The Squeeze

History was made in January 2021. Ryan Cohen joins the board on Jan 11. GME shoots +12% to $20 and then another +57% to $31. The media picks up the story and Elon Musk tweets “Gamestonk” and to the moon we go! Another +51% to $65. Then +92% to $150. And a deep fucking +135% to $347 before Vlad and the Hood ruined all the fun.

But we did it. History was made. The thesis was right. GME OGs are celebrating and drinking regal whiskey. Shorts got fucked and apes got born. WSB gains millions of normies. Financial world is never the same again.

And where am I? All-in CRSR with $1.7M and 1 share of GME I held on at a $20.81 cost basis. 

Lots of people have asked me about how I felt during this period, dealing with the FOMO or thinking about what could’ve been.

But the reality was: I was celebrating and dancing right alongside every single one of you GME winners. The thesis was right! This was an undervalued retail company that was way over-shorted.

Yes, I paper-handed in December and lost out on quick millions but that didn’t deter me to keep going. As a principle I don’t ever chase stocks so I let GME rocket however high it wanted to go and I just kept my eye on potential new plays. There’s always another play.

CRSR was bobbing up and down in a beautiful channel for most of Q1 until it wasn’t which made my Jan/Feb rather un-eventful merely breaking even.

## Chapter 2: RKT Up and Down

Huge short interest and a special dividend announcement in the 2/25 ER call seemed to awaken huge volume so I jumped on for the ride on 3/1 and it exploded 72% the next day gaining $1.2M overnight and bringing me to $2.9M! Almost a triple millionaire just like that.

Thinking these high volume squeeze plays usually go on for longer than a day, I held and it fell 33% immediately the next day losing me $1M. Let me tell you, **gaining a million and then losing it the very next day changes a man.**

As it rode the support line, I kept holding until the next 5/6 ER hoping that millennials are still in house-buying fever but that call gave conclusive evidence otherwise so I sold right after it dropped below support for a -19% loss.

## Chapter 3: Steel Gang

Next I decided to go all-in on CLF for the first time, an American steel company, thanks to one of the most well-researched theses I’ve ever read.

As you can see from my trading history above, CLF becomes my go-to safe haven for 2021 with 6 separate swings each netting decent % gains adding up to an amazing total $ gain.

But I’m a bit of a stock whore though as you’ll see, I love jumping around between different stocks trying to time the upswing. But CLF is like that dependable onii-chan you can return to after a good thrashing out in the harsh world and you need a good serving of humble pie.

# Arc of Erection - It’s squeezin’ season ($1.6M to $4.25M in 3 months)

Now it’s 6 months into the year and I was doing worse than the indexes! Little jack needed some more serious pumping. AMC had just christened a whole new cohort of apes, GME crossed $300 for the 3rd time, and it looked like squeezin’ season was upon us yet again.

## Chapter 4: Squeeze Trades

* **CLOV** \- 37% short interest and meme stocks were back in season so I left the safe embrace of steel to flirt with some squeezies. I finally stuck the multi-millionaire status going from $1.6M to $2.2M. Yes I sold a bit early and missed a giant squeeze on 6/8-6/9 which could’ve launched me to $5M+ but no point in having regrets, only learn from the mistakes
* **SOFI** \- Given this just deSPAC’d from IPOE to SOFI, there was a tingle that said this ChamathSPAC might do something crazy too. I woke up and saw a 148% short interest while on the toilet and in a blur went all-in cause that was too good to be true. Turns out it was and my app had a data error (likely due to the ticker change) and I should’ve checked other sources and finished jacking off for that post-nut clarity before going all-in. Due to the 2-day good faith restriction in my 401k, had to wait 2 days until I could sell for a -8% loss
* **MVST** \- Adam Jonas gave this stock a $6 PT while at $8, the same guy who gave TSLA a $10 PT when it was at $200 pre-split. Because of lolz, I decided to inverse him and got my biggest % gain of 70% in only 5 trading days skyrocketing past $3M to $4.25M. And while I sold RKT too late and CLOV too early, this one I sold juuust right. That’s called learning folks

# Arc of Ascension - Rise to legend ($4.25M to $8M in 3 months)

[*Kenja-taimu*](https://www.jlect.com/entry/2891/kenjataimu-kenjataimu/) *(賢者タイム) - The post-orgasmic period when a man's thoughts are no longer impaired by his sexual drive; he is thus likened to a ""sage"" of clear mind. Literally ""sage time"".*

## Chapter 5: Luck or Skills?

* **PLTR** \- Jumped in right before 8/12 ER with a 0/5 ER track record on a hunch it’s been so disappointing in all aspects since Jan that any positivity in the ER should give it a nice bump. Got my first W thanks to strong commercial contracts growth and +13% in the bag.
* **SKLZ** \- Another big disappointment since Feb but seems to have bottomed out. Also because of Big. Buck. Hunter and the best [thesis](https://reddit.com/user/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/comments/pgpm33/do_i_have_to_post_every_day_yes_im_still_in_sklz/hbcxi1t/) I’ve ever written. Nothing majorly notable besides the thesis.
* **AMZN** \- Flight to safety after losing $400K thinking AMZN hadn’t moved much in 2021 but being a boomer was not much fun.
* **TMC** \- Major FOMO from missing out on IRNT and OPAD’s deSPAC stock redemption gamma squeezes made me emotional. Mining special metals from the bottom of the ocean, sure why not? Well turns out it’s pretty [sketchy](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tmc-is-drowning-in-legal-woes-and-environmental-concerns-2021-10-25) so I’m glad I only threw $1M at it but still ate a -25% loss.

## Chapter 6: Plot Armor Fully Activated

* **CLF** \- It was so great to be back with steel gang after so many ins and outs just in time for 10/22 ER. I’ve never lost money with CLF and this time was no different. It was all up to LG to deliver and boy did he deliver with upgraded guidances and my 2nd ER win in a row. Getting on Twitch to hear the call live with steel gang is still one of my favorite memories. The [transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/22/cleveland-cliffs-clf-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/) is full of great quotes of LG demolishing analysts – “That's math lesson, not chemistry!” Officially a penta-millionaire with $5.7M.
* **TDOC** \- Time to go for the ER turkey with 3 Ws in a row. Went all-in on another decimated Aunt Cathy stock like PLTR with the hope that any positivity in the ER should give it a nice bump. On 10/27 after hours however, the stock drops -7% and little jack goes limp losing $400k. But the report looked… good?

## Chapter 7: Big Fucking Climax

Thanks to /u/_beto619 for [pointing](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRaceTo10Million/comments/qhvelq/nabbed_the_6_with_new_ath_of_61m_im_a/hiym91u/) me in the direction of BGFV, an undervalued sports retailer with a high short interest and earnings coming up. This play really had it all.

* Tossed in a million for the 11/2 ER thinking this could be like a CHGG or a CAR, literal coin flip. Turns out it was both, dropping 9% after hours but recovering by morning, just like TDOC, again with my plot armor at full power
* I decided to double down in the morning with another million and then tripled down and then said fuck it and went all in
* Found out the GME OGs including /u/Uberkikz11, /u/Jeffamazon, /u/FatAspirations, /u/CPTHubbard were all on top of this play as well and it felt like a reunion
* Created a Twitter account just to react live to BGFV on a Twitter Spaces with Rod Alzmann aka Uberkikz11. Someone managed to record the last 25 minutes of it [here](https://youtu.be/ZsgJ1629eio)
* Crossed $7M, then $8M, and even $9M and touched $10m for a literal 2 minutes and all I got was this [screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/eo8acvyoxtz71.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9b6f9cf64871010dc3354879e891f77da79ee9c)
* Decided in a moment of post-nut [epiphany](https://www.reddit.com/user/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/comments/quradf/fin_35k_to_8m_228x_in_21_months_officially/hkrtri3/), that I’ve achieved my original goal of escaping from wage slavery and $8M is enough and I’m officially retiring

I'm sure I’ll hit the elusive 8 digits again some time in life, it’s only 25% away

I look forward to seeing her again

# What's Next?

* Just got back from a lovely 18-day trip in Europe enjoying the delicious delicacies of being FATFIRE such as paying 30 euros for tiramisu to be brought up by room service at midnight and currently relaxing with family on a beautiful snowy mountain.
* My plan is to DCA into SPY/QQQ over the next few months as I have no idea which way the market will go. While it feels like I did time the top on many individual stocks by retiring on 11/15, SPY/QQQ is right back to where it was on 11/15. I’m still worried about the effects of tapering, interest rate increases, and potential lowered guidances in next round of ERs but the market also seems to be just as strong as ever so DCA seems like the best strategy here.
   * Why am I being so conservative all of a sudden? Honestly I’m just tired from trying to perfectly time everything. It’s stressful keeping up with all the news and you feel bad if you mis-timed it. I want to focus my time and energy on other things so DCA allows me to re-enter the market with less stress
* In the new year I plan to quit my job and focus on 3 things: my health, my house, and a special project. I want to live a long healthy life to enjoy this newfound generational wealth, buy all the fancy toys and do all the fancy renovations to live in a beautiful home, and build a product based on everything I’ve learned these past 2 years about personal finance and community for you guys. And no it’s not a paid newsletter or chat group or anything stupid like that. Stay tuned!

# Final Message for My Little Jacks

I really believe I just got very lucky.

* The initial $35K in my 401k was an accident. I actually wanted to take my annual Jan bonus in cash to buy some toys but missed the cutoff date to change it in Dec so it defaulted to throwing my annual bonus in my 401k
* Started trading in Feb 2020 as COVID created the most bi-polar volatile market ever swinging between covid and recovery stocks quickly growing $35k to $900k in 4 months, something that is irreproducible
* Continued trading as meme stocks and short squeezes shook the financial world before they re-tuned their algorithms and shortened their potency
* Literally got lucky on 4 coin-flip-type ERs in a row

Live to fight another day. If it’s good enough to screenshot, it’s good enough to sell. Don’t chase. Use independent thinking. It’s just money. 

All these sayings… all these lessons… at the end of this journey I’m still not sure what to make of it all. Life is short. Enjoy it as best you can. Try to do good. And try to be lucky.

I’ll still be around, probably not posting much but maybe some comments here and there.

It’s been an absolute **life changing** time with you all.

# Flashback - Christmas 2020

Let’s set the stage. Remember December 2020 ya’ll?

I sold 88,233 shares GME at $15.50 for some random dog toy in a box company. There were no apes yet, just Ryan Cohen buying more shares with hopes of a company turnaround. There were record COVID cases, vaccines were just approved, and there was even a British virus mutation on the way that turned out to be Delta!

# Arc of Blue Balls - Teasing little jack ($1.75M to $1.6M in 6 months)

## Chapter 1: The Squeeze

History was made in January 2021. Ryan Cohen joins the board on Jan 11. GME shoots +12% to $20 and then another +57% to $31. The media picks up the story and Elon Musk tweets “Gamestonk” and to the moon we go! Another +51% to $65. Then +92% to $150. And a deep fucking +135% to $347 before Vlad and the Hood ruined all the fun.

But we did it. History was made. The thesis was right. GME OGs are celebrating and drinking regal whiskey. Shorts got fucked and apes got born. WSB gains millions of normies. Financial world is never the same again.

And where am I? All-in CRSR with $1.7M and 1 share of GME I held on at a $20.81 cost basis. 

Lots of people have asked me about how I felt during this period, dealing with the FOMO or thinking about what could’ve been.

But the reality was: I was celebrating and dancing right alongside every single one of you GME winners. The thesis was right! This was an undervalued retail company that was way over-shorted.

Yes, I paper-handed in December and lost out on quick millions but that didn’t deter me to keep going. As a principle I don’t ever chase stocks so I let GME rocket however high it wanted to go and I just kept my eye on potential new plays. There’s always another play.

CRSR was bobbing up and down in a beautiful channel for most of Q1 until it wasn’t which made my Jan/Feb rather un-eventful merely breaking even.

## Chapter 2: RKT Up and Down

Huge short interest and a special dividend announcement in the 2/25 ER call seemed to awaken huge volume so I jumped on for the ride on 3/1 and it exploded 72% the next day gaining $1.2M overnight and bringing me to $2.9M! Almost a triple millionaire just like that.

Thinking these high volume squeeze plays usually go on for longer than a day, I held and it fell 33% immediately the next day losing me $1M. Let me tell you, **gaining a million and then losing it the very next day changes a man.**

As it rode the support line, I kept holding until the next 5/6 ER hoping that millennials are still in house-buying fever but that call gave conclusive evidence otherwise so I sold right after it dropped below support for a -19% loss.

## Chapter 3: Steel Gang

Next I decided to go all-in on CLF for the first time, an American steel company, thanks to one of the most well-researched theses I’ve ever read.

As you can see from my trading history above, CLF becomes my go-to safe haven for 2021 with 6 separate swings each netting decent % gains adding up to an amazing total $ gain.

But I’m a bit of a stock whore though as you’ll see, I love jumping around between different stocks trying to time the upswing. But CLF is like that dependable onii-chan you can return to after a good thrashing out in the harsh world and you need a good serving of humble pie.

# Arc of Erection - It’s squeezin’ season ($1.6M to $4.25M in 3 months)

Now it’s 6 months into the year and I was doing worse than the indexes! Little jack needed some more serious pumping. AMC had just christened a whole new cohort of apes, GME crossed $300 for the 3rd time, and it looked like squeezin’ season was upon us yet again.

## Chapter 4: Squeeze Trades

* **CLOV** \- 37% short interest and meme stocks were back in season so I left the safe embrace of steel to flirt with some squeezies. I finally stuck the multi-millionaire status going from $1.6M to $2.2M. Yes I sold a bit early and missed a giant squeeze on 6/8-6/9 which could’ve launched me to $5M+ but no point in having regrets, only learn from the mistakes
* **SOFI** \- Given this just deSPAC’d from IPOE to SOFI, there was a tingle that said this ChamathSPAC might do something crazy too. I woke up and saw a 148% short interest while on the toilet and in a blur went all-in cause that was too good to be true. Turns out it was and my app had a data error (likely due to the ticker change) and I should’ve checked other sources and finished jacking off for that post-nut clarity before going all-in. Due to the 2-day good faith restriction in my 401k, had to wait 2 days until I could sell for a -8% loss
* **MVST** \- Adam Jonas gave this stock a $6 PT while at $8, the same guy who gave TSLA a $10 PT when it was at $200 pre-split. Because of lolz, I decided to inverse him and got my biggest % gain of 70% in only 5 trading days skyrocketing past $3M to $4.25M. And while I sold RKT too late and CLOV too early, this one I sold juuust right. That’s called learning folks

# Arc of Ascension - Rise to legend ($4.25M to $8M in 3 months)

[*Kenja-taimu*](https://www.jlect.com/entry/2891/kenjataimu-kenjataimu/) *(賢者タイム) - The post-orgasmic period when a man's thoughts are no longer impaired by his sexual drive; he is thus likened to a ""sage"" of clear mind. Literally ""sage time"".*

## Chapter 5: Luck or Skills?

* **PLTR** \- Jumped in right before 8/12 ER with a 0/5 ER track record on a hunch it’s been so disappointing in all aspects since Jan that any positivity in the ER should give it a nice bump. Got my first W thanks to strong commercial contracts growth and +13% in the bag.
* **SKLZ** \- Another big disappointment since Feb but seems to have bottomed out. Also because of Big. Buck. Hunter and the best [thesis](https://reddit.com/user/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/comments/pgpm33/do_i_have_to_post_every_day_yes_im_still_in_sklz/hbcxi1t/) I’ve ever written. Nothing majorly notable besides the thesis.
* **AMZN** \- Flight to safety after losing $400K thinking AMZN hadn’t moved much in 2021 but being a boomer was not much fun.
* **TMC** \- Major FOMO from missing out on IRNT and OPAD’s deSPAC stock redemption gamma squeezes made me emotional. Mining special metals from the bottom of the ocean, sure why not? Well turns out it’s pretty [sketchy](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tmc-is-drowning-in-legal-woes-and-environmental-concerns-2021-10-25) so I’m glad I only threw $1M at it but still ate a -25% loss.

## Chapter 6: Plot Armor Fully Activated

* **CLF** \- It was so great to be back with steel gang after so many ins and outs just in time for 10/22 ER. I’ve never lost money with CLF and this time was no different. It was all up to LG to deliver and boy did he deliver with upgraded guidances and my 2nd ER win in a row. Getting on Twitch to hear the call live with steel gang is still one of my favorite memories. The [transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/22/cleveland-cliffs-clf-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/) is full of great quotes of LG demolishing analysts – “That's math lesson, not chemistry!” Officially a penta-millionaire with $5.7M.
* **TDOC** \- Time to go for the ER turkey with 3 Ws in a row. Went all-in on another decimated Aunt Cathy stock like PLTR with the hope that any positivity in the ER should give it a nice bump. On 10/27 after hours however, the stock drops -7% and little jack goes limp losing $400k. But the report looked… good? In a literal example of main character plot armor, the stock reverses in the morning and ends up +7% instead and little jack nuts to being a hexa-millionaire with $6.1M.

* Decided in a moment of post-nut [epiphany](https://www.reddit.com/user/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/comments/quradf/fin_35k_to_8m_228x_in_21_months_officially/hkrtri3/), that I’ve achieved my original goal of escaping from wage slavery and $8M is enough and I’m officially retiring

I'm sure I’ll hit the elusive 8 digits again some time in life, it’s only 25% away

I look forward to seeing her again

Gather 'round again fellow retards and autists. SIR JACK A LOT is back with a sequel to last year’s [Magnum Dong Opus](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kjyzh7/a_sir_jack_a_lot_christmas_carol_my_magnum_dong/) on turning $35K to $1.75M (50X) in 2020 by going all-in on a single stock all-shares.

In this post I share my journey from $1.75M to $8M in 2021 and announce my official retirement from trading. Read on for receipts and an epic tale of blue balls to hard-on erection and a climactic finale.

My secret? Post-nut clarity.

# Flashback - Christmas 2020

Let’s set the stage. Remember December 2020 ya’ll?

I sold 88,233 shares GME at $15.50 for some random dog toy in a box company. There were no apes yet, just Ryan Cohen buying more shares with hopes of a company turnaround. There were record COVID cases, vaccines were just approved, and there was even a British virus mutation on the way that turned out to be Delta!

# Arc of Blue Balls - Teasing little jack ($1.75M to $1.6M in 6 months)

**Chapter 1: The Squeeze**

History was made in January 2021. Ryan Cohen joins the board on Jan 11. GME shoots +12% to $20 and then another +57% to $31. The media picks up the story and Elon Musk tweets “Gamestonk” and to the moon we go! Another +51% to $65. Then +92% to $150. And a deep fucking +135% to $347 before Vlad and the Hood ruined all the fun.

But we did it. History was made. The thesis was right. GME OGs are celebrating and drinking regal whiskey. Shorts got fucked and apes got born. WSB gains millions of normies. Financial world is never the same again.

And where am I? All-in CRSR with $1.7M and 1 share of GME I held on at a $20.81 cost basis. 

Lots of people have asked me about how I felt during this period, dealing with the FOMO or thinking about what could’ve been.

But the reality was: I was celebrating and dancing right alongside every single one of you GME winners. The thesis was right! This was an undervalued retail company that was way over-shorted.

Yes, I paper-handed in December and lost out on quick millions but that didn’t deter me to keep going. As a principle I don’t ever chase stocks so I let GME rocket however high it wanted to go and I just kept my eye on potential new plays. There’s always another play.

CRSR was bobbing up and down in a beautiful channel for most of Q1 until it wasn’t which made my Jan/Feb rather un-eventful merely breaking even.

**Chapter 2: RKT Up and Down**

Huge short interest and a special dividend announcement in the 2/25 ER call seemed to awaken huge volume so I jumped on for the ride on 3/1 and it exploded 72% the next day gaining $1.2M overnight and bringing me to $2.9M! Almost a triple millionaire just like that.

Thinking these high volume squeeze plays usually go on for longer than a day, I held and it fell 33% immediately the next day losing me $1M. Let me tell you, **gaining a million and then losing it the very next day changes a man.**

As it rode the support line, I kept holding until the next 5/6 ER hoping that millennials are still in house-buying fever but that call gave conclusive evidence otherwise so I sold right after it dropped below support for a -19% loss.

**Chapter 3: Steel Gang**

Next I decided to go all-in on CLF for the first time, an American steel company, thanks to one of the most well-researched theses I’ve ever read.

As you can see from my trading history above, CLF becomes my go-to safe haven for 2021 with 6 separate swings each netting decent % gains adding up to an amazing total $ gain.

But I’m a bit of a stock whore though as you’ll see, I love jumping around between different stocks trying to time the upswing. But CLF is like that dependable onii-chan you can return to after a good thrashing out in the harsh world and you need a good serving of humble pie.

# Arc of Erection - It’s squeezin’ season ($1.6M to $4.25M in 3 months)

Now it’s 6 months into the year and I was doing worse than the indexes! Little jack needed some more serious pumping. AMC had just christened a whole new cohort of apes, GME crossed $300 for the 3rd time, and it looked like squeezin’ season was upon us yet again.

**Chapter 4: Squeeze Trades**

* **CLOV** \- 37% short interest and meme stocks were back in season so I left the safe embrace of steel to flirt with some squeezies. I finally stuck the multi-millionaire status going from $1.6M to $2.2M. Yes I sold a bit early and missed a giant squeeze on 6/8-6/9 which could’ve launched me to $5M+ but no point in having regrets, only learn from the mistakes
* **SOFI** \- Given this just deSPAC’d from IPOE to SOFI, there was a tingle that said this ChamathSPAC might do something crazy too. I woke up and saw a 148% short interest while on the toilet and in a blur went all-in cause that was too good to be true. Turns out it was and my app had a data error (likely due to the ticker change) and I should’ve checked other sources and finished jacking off for that post-nut clarity before going all-in. Due to the 2-day good faith restriction in my 401k, had to wait 2 days until I could sell for a -8% loss
* **MVST** \- Adam Jonas gave this stock a $6 PT while at $8, the same guy who gave TSLA a $10 PT when it was at $200 pre-split. Because of lolz, I decided to inverse him and got my biggest % gain of 70% in only 5 trading days skyrocketing past $3M to $4.25M. And while I sold RKT too late and CLOV too early, this one I sold juuust right. That’s called learning folks

**Chapter 5: Luck or Skills?**

* **PLTR** \- Jumped in right before 8/12 ER with a 0/5 ER track record on a hunch it’s been so disappointing in all aspects since Jan that any positivity in the ER should give it a nice bump. Got my first W thanks to strong commercial contracts growth and +13% in the bag.
* **SKLZ** \- Another big disappointment since Feb but seems to have bottomed out. Also because of Big. Buck. Hunter and the best [thesis](https://reddit.com/user/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/comments/pgpm33/do_i_have_to_post_every_day_yes_im_still_in_sklz/hbcxi1t/) I’ve ever written. Nothing majorly notable besides the thesis.
* **AMZN** \- Flight to safety after losing $400K thinking AMZN hadn’t moved much in 2021 but being a boomer was not much fun.
* **TMC** \- Major FOMO from missing out on IRNT and OPAD’s deSPAC stock redemption gamma squeezes made me emotional. Mining special metals from the bottom of the ocean, sure why not? Well turns out it’s pretty [sketchy](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tmc-is-drowning-in-legal-woes-and-environmental-concerns-2021-10-25) so I’m glad I only threw $1M at it but still ate a -25% loss.

**Chapter 6: Plot Armor Fully Activated**

* **CLF** \- It was so great to be back with steel gang after so many ins and outs just in time for 10/22 ER. I’ve never lost money with CLF and this time was no different. It was all up to LG to deliver and boy did he deliver with upgraded guidances and my 2nd ER win in a row. Getting on Twitch to hear the call live with steel gang is still one of my favorite memories. The [transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/22/cleveland-cliffs-clf-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/) is full of great quotes of LG demolishing analysts – “That's math lesson, not chemistry!” Officially a penta-millionaire with $5.7M.
* **TDOC** \- Time to go for the ER turkey with 3 Ws in a row. Went all-in on another decimated Aunt Cathy stock like PLTR with the hope that any positivity in the ER should give it a nice bump. On 10/27 after hours however, the stock drops -7% and little jack goes limp losing $400k. But the report looked… good? In a literal example of main character plot armor, the stock reverses in the morning and ends up +7% instead and little jack nuts to being a hexa-millionaire with $6.1M.

**Chapter 7: Big Fucking Climax**

* Tossed in a million for the 11/2 ER thinking this could be like a CHGG or a CAR, literal coin flip. Turns out it was both, dropping 9% after hours but recovering by morning, just like TDOC, again with my plot armor at full power
* I decided to double down in the morning with another million and then tripled down and then said fuck it and went all in
* Found out the GME OGs including /u/Uberkikz11, /u/Jeffamazon, /u/FatAspirations, /u/CPTHubbard were all on top of this play as well and it felt like a reunion
* Created a Twitter account just to react live to BGFV on a Twitter Spaces with Rod Alzmann aka Uberkikz11. Someone managed to record the last 25 minutes of it [here](https://youtu.be/ZsgJ1629eio)
* Crossed $7M, then $8M, and even $9M and touched $10m for a literal 2 minutes and all I got was this [screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/eo8acvyoxtz71.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9b6f9cf64871010dc3354879e891f77da79ee9c)

I'm sure I’ll hit the elusive 8 digits again some time in life, it’s only 25% away

I look forward to seeing her again

**What's Next?**

* Just got back from a lovely 18-day trip in Europe enjoying the delicious delicacies of being FATFIRE such as paying 30 euros for tiramisu to be brought up by room service at midnight and currently relaxing with family on a beautiful snowy mountain.
* My plan is to DCA into SPY/QQQ over the next few months as I have no idea which way the market will go. While it feels like I did time the top on many individual stocks by retiring on 11/15, SPY/QQQ is right back to where it was on 11/15. I’m still worried about the effects of tapering, interest rate increases, and potential lowered guidances in next round of ERs but the market also seems to be just as strong as ever so DCA seems like the best strategy here.
   * Why am I being so conservative all of a sudden? Honestly I’m just tired from trying to perfectly time everything. It’s stressful keeping up with all the news and you feel bad if you mis-timed it. I want to focus my time and energy on other things so DCA allows me to re-enter the market with less stress
* In the new year I plan to quit my job and focus on 3 things: my health, my house, and a special project. I want to live a long healthy life to enjoy this newfound generational wealth, buy all the fancy toys and do all the fancy renovations to live in a beautiful home, and build a product based on everything I’ve learned these past 2 years about personal finance and community for you guys. And no it’s not a paid newsletter or chat group or anything stupid like that. Stay tuned!

## Final Message for My Little Jacks

I really believe I just got very lucky.

* The initial $35K in my 401k was an accident. I actually wanted to take my annual Jan bonus in cash to buy some toys but missed the cutoff date to change it in Dec so it defaulted to throwing my annual bonus in my 401k
* Started trading in Feb 2020 as COVID created the most bi-polar volatile market ever swinging between covid and recovery stocks quickly growing $35k to $900k in 4 months, something that is irreproducible
* Continued trading as meme stocks and short squeezes shook the financial world before they re-tuned their algorithms and shortened their potency
* Literally got lucky on 4 coin-flip-type ERs in a row

Live to fight another day. If it’s good enough to screenshot, it’s good enough to sell. Don’t chase. Use independent thinking. It’s just money. 

All these sayings… all these lessons… at the end of this journey I’m still not sure what to make of it all. Life is short. Enjoy it as best you can. Try to do good. And try to be lucky.

I’ll still be around, probably not posting much but maybe some comments here and there.

It’s been an absolute **life changing** time with you all.

# Flashback - Christmas 2020

Let’s set the stage. Remember December 2020 ya’ll?

I sold 88,233 shares GME at $15.50 for some random dog toy in a box company. There were no apes yet, just Ryan Cohen buying more shares with hopes of a company turnaround. There were record COVID cases, vaccines were just approved, and there was even a British virus mutation on the way that turned out to be Delta!

# Arc of Blue Balls - Teasing little jack ($1.75M to $1.6M in 6 months)

**Chapter 1: The Squeeze**

History was made in January 2021. Ryan Cohen joins the board on Jan 11. GME shoots +12% to $20 and then another +57% to $31. The media picks up the story and Elon Musk tweets “Gamestonk” and to the moon we go! Another +51% to $65. Then +92% to $150. And a deep fucking +135% to $347 before Vlad and the Hood ruined all the fun.

But we did it. History was made. The thesis was right. GME OGs are celebrating and drinking regal whiskey. Shorts got fucked and apes got born. WSB gains millions of normies. Financial world is never the same again.

And where am I? All-in CRSR with $1.7M and 1 share of GME I held on at a $20.81 cost basis. 

Lots of people have asked me about how I felt during this period, dealing with the FOMO or thinking about what could’ve been.

But the reality was: I was celebrating and dancing right alongside every single one of you GME winners. The thesis was right! This was an undervalued retail company that was way over-shorted.

Yes, I paper-handed in December and lost out on quick millions but that didn’t deter me to keep going. As a principle I don’t ever chase stocks so I let GME rocket however high it wanted to go and I just kept my eye on potential new plays. There’s always another play.

CRSR was bobbing up and down in a beautiful channel for most of Q1 until it wasn’t which made my Jan/Feb rather un-eventful merely breaking even.

**Chapter 2: RKT Up and Down**

Huge short interest and a special dividend announcement in the 2/25 ER call seemed to awaken huge volume so I jumped on for the ride on 3/1 and it exploded 72% the next day gaining $1.2M overnight and bringing me to $2.9M! Almost a triple millionaire just like that.

**Chapter 3: Steel Gang**

Next I decided to go all-in on CLF for the first time, an American steel company, thanks to one of the most well-researched theses I’ve ever read.

**Trade Setup**

* Ever single trade was done on my iPhone 7 Plus with the TD Ameritrade app. Usually on my Toto toilet. I use Webull desktop client and TradingView website for watching charts and technical analysis during the day on a second monitor separate from my work setup
   * I’ve since upgraded to the iPhone 13 Pro Max
* My 157 stock watch list in case people find it interesting, I’m constantly scanning these to watch trends and if anything interesting catches my eye: AMPL, AAWW, ADBE, AFRM, ASTS, ARKF, AMC, ARKG, ARKK, AMZN, AAL, AI, ABNB, ASAN, AMD, AAPL, BBBY, BGFV, BKKT, BX, BAC, BMBL, BB, BUZZ, BARK, BA, BYND, BABA, CHGG, CAR, CLNE, CLF, CCL, CAKE, CVNA, CRM, CRSP, CHWY, COST, CRSR, CLOV, COIN, DWAC, DNUT, DAL, DKNG, DOCU, DDOG, DASH, DBX, DIS, ENPH, FCEL, FVRR, F, FUBO, FB, FXI, FSLY, GTLB, GS, GOOG, GME, GLD, HLTH, HOOD, HD, HEAR, IPOF, ICLN, JD, KOSS, LC, LMT, LMND, LOW, LOGI, LCID, LUV, LULU, LYFT, MRNA, MTTR, MS, MVST, MP, MTCH, MGM, MVIS, MT, MSFT, NNDM, NCLH, NUE, NKE, NIO, NET, NVDA, NFLX, OPEN, OKTA, PFE, PSFE, PRPL, PINS, POSH, PD, PLBY, PLUG, PLTR, PTON, PYPL, QS, RIVN, RTX, RIDE, RBLX, RDFN, RKT, RCL, SDC, SOFI, SLV, SPCE, SKLZ, SFT, STLD, SBUX, SHOP, SNAP, SQ, TOST, TGT, TTD, TTCF, TWTR, TNDM, TDOC, TWLO, TSLA, UPST, UWMC, UAL, UBER, U, VIAC, VALE, VRM, V, WOOF, WISH, WKHS, W, X, ZIM, Z, ZM

## Final Message for My Little Jacks

I really believe I just got very lucky.

* The initial $35K in my 401k was an accident. I actually wanted to take my annual Jan bonus in cash to buy some toys but missed the cutoff date to change it in Dec so it defaulted to throwing my annual bonus in my 401k
* Started trading in Feb 2020 as COVID created the most bi-polar volatile market ever swinging between covid and recovery stocks quickly growing $35k to $900k in 4 months, something that is irreproducible
* Continued trading as meme stocks and short squeezes shook the financial world before they re-tuned their algorithms and shortened their potency
* Literally got lucky on 4 coin-flip-type ERs in a row

Live to fight another day. If it’s good enough to screenshot, it’s good enough to sell. Don’t chase. Use independent thinking. It’s just money. 

All these sayings… all these lessons… at the end of this journey I’m still not sure what to make of it all. Life is short. Enjoy it as best you can. Try to do good. And try to be lucky.

I’ll still be around, probably not posting much but maybe some comments here and there.

It’s been an absolute **life changing** time with you all.

$BBY has just released Q3 earnings today before market open sending shares plummeting -18%.

While beating earnings projections by relatively small margins, my theory in what caused such a drop is Q3 EPS falling almost 40% from Q1 and Q2 2022. 
I personally believe these inflated earnings numbers stem from unemployment assistance money, and stimulus/child tax credit money being used to purchase items from $BBY that wouldn’t normally be attainable without this assistance. 

Another attributing factor to $BBY’s inflated earnings in the last 2Q’s is possibly an influx in sales from customers “Cabin Fever” + extra free time, console and video game sales are through the roof, which are a large part of Best Buy’s inventory.

So why would BestBuy return to trading at Q2 prices if the reason for it trading so high was inflated sales numbers caused by one in a life time external forces?

Simply put it won’t, but the way I see it
Theres 20% upside sitting on the table just to get back to share prices 1 week ago.

TLDR; $REV has very low float and trading volume but an uncharacteristically robust options market that skews very bullish for the January 2022 expiration. It also has a relatively high short interest for its very low trading volume. Buying pressure could trigger a 1-2 gamma squeeze short squeeze event on the shares. This is unlikely to happen after January 21st if it has not already happened by that time.*

$REV (yes, the cosmetics company Revlon) is an extremely low hanging target for the retail-investing crowd to run with and rally to multiple times the current share price. Trading volume on this one is low, so it won’t take much to move things. Small retail investors should pay attention. The window for a price run is only for about the next 3-4 weeks based on the options market, upcoming dilution, and institutional moves. **Read on if I’ve piqued your interest:**

Let’s get the obvious out of the way. Revlon has not been doing so well over the last 5+ years. An overload of debt coupled with the pandemic limiting in person activities meant that the demand cosmetics and personal care products dropped and the company didn’t have the balance sheet or cash flow to take risks, pivot, or adapt. After a drop as low as $4 per share in November 2020, the price has been relatively stable over the last year in the $10-12 range with a few short-lived breakouts. Notably the company showed better than expected progress on its cost cutting and turnaround program in the most recent quarter, which gave it a short-lived break out to $17 that has since reverted to the same $10-$12 channel. This puts the market cap in the $500-700 million dollar range, right in the heart of small cap dixie. **Here is where it gets interesting:**

Almost all of $REV stock is owned by an eccentric gentleman named Ronald Perelman. **Perelman, a billionaire several times over, owns over 46 million of the 54 million shares outstanding.** Coupled with smaller holdings from other C Suite and board members, Revlon’s inside ownership is an incredibly high 86-87%. This number has been steady with VIRTUALLY NO insider buying or selling for 2.5 years. They didn’t sell on the drop to $4 last year and they didn’t sell on the pop to $18 earlier this year. Insiders are sitting on big losses from $REV’s days in the $20s before the pandemic. My belief is that Perelman is either holding out for a big turnaround to recoup his investment before divesting, or he is planning to take over the rest of the shares and take the company private. Either way, the probability of him continuing to hold those 46 million shares for the near term appears high. 

So we’ve got a float of around 7.5 million shares for a ‘floating market cap’ of $80-$85 million today. So far, nothing too noteworthy other than a low float, low volume stock. When evaluating short or gamma squeeze potential, I like to see a tighter supply than this and have some idea of the volume and velocity of shares movements when prices start moving. **So let’s break out those remaining 7.5 million shares and see what we find there.** 

Remember the market cap? $REV sits right in the middle of NYSE small cap territory which has it listed in the Russell 2000 and other small cap index funds where market cap requirements often start around half a billion. The familiar names of Vanguard and Blackrock hold over 1 million shares in very low turnover index and segment funds. If we pull the other lower turnover ETFs and mutual funds in to the fold, I get to around 1.3 million shares in ETFs that I categorize as ‘probably not going anywhere right now’. Under that assumption, **our 7.5 million float trims down to about 6.2 million shares that I expect to be liquid in the near term.**

Now the other institutions holding shares. **There are another 4 million shares held by institutions reporting holdings through their quarterly 13-Fs.** There are no guarantees in what these firms will do with these shares or when. However, we might be able to infer some of what we can expect to see based on history with some of the larger holders. **So let’s look at a few of those:**

* **Mittleman Investment Management:** These guys have been in $REV for years. Going back to 2018 they held as many as 3.3 million shares. They unloaded about 1 million in the 2020 pandemic sell off. But they’ve otherwise been slowly reducing their position quarter by quarter. As of the last filings effective September 30th, they held 1.397 million shares (down 72,000 from the prior quarter). In June of 2021, $REV had a run up to $18 per share and Mittleman reduced their holdings by about 300,000 in that quarter. Given the trajectory of their divesting and a similar run to $17 earlier in Q4, **I anticipate current holdings of between 1.0 and 1.1 million shares today. Price** may need to move up 50% or more from the current levels to see that accelerate. 
* **Alberta Investment Management:** Holders of 1.0-1.4 million shares going back to 2018. Their holdings have not changed at all in several quarters and include periods where the stock fell to $4 and rose to $17. Most of their holdings were acquired during a period of $20-25 per share so I don’t see any immediate evidence of a divestiture. **I have plugged them in at an assumption of 1 million shares held today that are relatively sticky without a big run up in price.** 
* **Others (Nuveen, State Street, Geode, Berylson, and others):** The larger holders in this group have generally been either steady or accumulating over the last few quarters. There are over 1 million shares held by this group today. However, I don’t feel as confident in anticipating what they may or may not do in the event of routine price action and the course of business. **I have baked in only half of these shares in my ‘probably not moving’ bucket and pulled another 500,000 from shares likely to trade in the near term.** 

**In my share bucketing, I pull out these 2.5 million shares plus the prior 1.3 million ETF shares from the active float.** So our 7.5 million float gets reduced by about 3.8 million shares to 3.7 million shares that I estimate are in play on a typical trading day. 

Realistically, the true number is likely much lower as evidenced by the average trading volume. There are other smaller funds and holders that we did not even glance at above. There are also many hundreds or even thousands of employees at Revlon that are granted RSUs, options, or hold equity through other means**. Internally registered insiders don’t report their trades or holdings to the SEC or count as closely held shares. But, they are usually held to quarterly blackout periods to promote insider trading compliance.** Those internal blackout periods, by the way, typically start a bit before the end of a fiscal quarter and run through the day after the next earnings report. **We’re in the middle of that right now and will be through early Feb.** We have no public data to quantify these share counts but it undoubtedly takes another large chunk out of what is truly ‘tradable’. The market cap of shares that are actually trading for $REV could be as low as $20-$30 million or even less. 

So we’ve got us a low float stock with an even lower ‘real float’. Cool, but there are plenty of low float stocks out there, right? So what makes $REV a retail trading hot commodity?

**1.** **$REV trades options on NYSE.** As 2021 showed us, an options market is a supercharger for price action. Most low float, low trading market cap stocks do not qualify for options trading on NYSE. $REV has BARELY maintained the required 7 million publicly held shares to continue trading options on NYSE. **My analysis suggests to me that only 2 to 3 million shares are actually functioning day to day like floating shares.** Try to find lower trading liquidity on NYSE with options contracts trading over the same range of dates and as many strike prices. I’ll save you some time… you can’t.

**2.** **The existing open interest in that options market is already a gamma time bomb.** There are about 14,000 open option contracts today with 77% of those being calls (\~10,700 contracts). But out of those open call contracts, **almost 6,500 contracts are for January 2022 (next month) and almost all of them are on near the money or out of them money strike prices**. Since we are only a few weeks away from expiration for a low volatility stock, the Delta on these contracts is very low and very little Delta hedging has taken place to date**. January 2022 has substantial open interest on calls for every strike from $12.50 all the way up to $25.** Based on current Delta, market makers only need about 45,000 shares to hedge these positions today. If the price of $REV were to go up $1, roughly an additional 25,000 shares need to be bought to hedge those open calls. **Right now, it takes several hours for 25,000 shares of $REV to trade. The price action from a sudden purchase of 25,000 shares would be huge.** The closer we get to expiration and the further up the price goes, the more delta hedging required and the vicious cycle sets off. And this is just based on open interest TODAY. The impact magnifies as traders buy and open more calls, something that could really take off if a lot of eyeballs find this post. 

Stated simply, the current options set up on $REV is a coiled spring going in to January options expiration. The gamma squeeze potential only gets larger as more short term calls are purchased and written.

So, we’ve got very low float and liquidity with an options market set up to force buying shares that will be very hard to find. That establishes that we’ve got something prone to violent price moves. But where is the exit? **Aren’t we just pumping this up to sell it to the next bag holder that made it too late to profit? That’s where point #3 comes in to solidify this as a retail gainer that isn’t built on turning your peers in to bag holders.** 

**3.** **Short interest is deceptively high and vulnerable.** Short interest sits at 1.1 million shares. That is about 15% of the ‘float’. That is high-ish, but doesn’t scream short squeeze. But as we’ve established above, a ton of floating shares are not going to be trading in the immediate term without a big price move up to coax inside and institutional sellers out of hiding. **In the immediate future, the functional short interest runs closer to 50% in my opinion.** The extremely low trading volume also means that any attempt to cover and close short positions will quickly overwhelm $REV liquidity and drive prices higher. The historical short interest changes also show most of the short interest increases and short trading volume took place in the same $10-12 range that the stock sits in today. Most short sellers are not sitting on big open profits that can wait out a price increase without some pain. In the November price run up to $17, we saw short interest decrease by 160,000 shares, which I believe was a contributor to the rapid 70% move in share price between November 2nd and November 8th. There are 1.1 million more shorts out there and the potential combination of a gamma fueled short squeeze 1-2 punch makes hoping for a reversal a more dangerous play than it would have been two months ago. **This is a much more dangerous stock to bet against than it was during past price runs.**

**What makes $REV different from other squeeze DD out there?** The volume of retail activity needed to get things moving would be substantially lower than other recent squeezes over the last year. Even low market cap stocks usually start trading with such high volumes that it takes overwhelming buying pressure to overcome the inertia of the stock price. $REV has no inertia. It is a balloon floating around silently. A few dozen small retail traders could probably materially shift the dynamics of the stock if they decided to play the stock bullish. GME, AMC, and others took tens or hundreds of thousands of retail players to join the fray. 

**When could a gamma/short driven run up happen?** The window of opportunity is likely limited to only the next few weeks and no later. As of now, we only see high open interest in the January options contracts. A sudden shift in open interest to February could extend the window of opportunity by a month. But, there are no March or April contracts and everything from May onward has minimal activity so far. If you read the last 10-Q filing, you will also note that March 2022 has a huge vesting of RSUs to employees and executives. It looks to likely be somewhere in the 500k to 1M share range, which will push more shares in to the trading float as well. As we go further out in the future there is also less certainty around the insiders and large funds holding remaining steady and that tight ‘real float’ is less and less likely to continue as you look further in to the future.

**What is the potential price move in this one**? It is always hard to say for sure. The current options setup suggests that $25 is not out of the question in a gamma/short combo punch. If there is a big uptake in awareness, things can always get carried away so I never put a hard limit on the upper end of a squeeze driven price move. However, I expect prices over $20-$25 to start to bring more shares to market by institutional holders. 

**What has to happen for this price movement to trigger?** There are no guarantees, but inflows of money in to common shares AND January 2022 calls in the $10 to $15 range seem to be where this one is the most vulnerable. If upward price movement starts, commons + calls strikes above $15 all the way up to the highest strike of $30 would be required to see the highest possible price movement and give the highest probability of short covering happening before the January option expiration on the Jan 21st.

TLDR; $REV has very low float and trading volume but an uncharacteristically robust options market that skews very bullish for the January 2022 expiration. It also has a relatively high short interest for its very low trading volume. Buying pressure could trigger a 1-2 gamma squeeze short squeeze event on the shares. This is unlikely to happen after January 21st if it has not already happened by that time.*

$REV (yes, the cosmetics company Revlon) is an extremely low hanging target for the retail-investing crowd to run with and rally to multiple times the current share price. Trading volume on this one is low, so it won’t take much to move things. Small retail investors should pay attention. The window for a price run is only for about the next 3-4 weeks based on the options market, upcoming dilution, and institutional moves. **Read on if I’ve piqued your interest:**

Let’s get the obvious out of the way. Revlon has not been doing so well over the last 5+ years. An overload of debt coupled with the pandemic limiting in person activities meant that the demand cosmetics and personal care products dropped and the company didn’t have the balance sheet or cash flow to take risks, pivot, or adapt. After a drop as low as $4 per share in November 2020, the price has been relatively stable over the last year in the $10-12 range with a few short-lived breakouts. Notably the company showed better than expected progress on its cost cutting and turnaround program in the most recent quarter, which gave it a short-lived break out to $17 that has since reverted to the same $10-$12 channel. This puts the market cap in the $500-700 million dollar range, right in the heart of small cap dixie. **Here is where it gets interesting:**

Almost all of $REV stock is owned by an eccentric gentleman named Ronald Perelman. **Perelman, a billionaire several times over, owns over 46 million of the 54 million shares outstanding.** Coupled with smaller holdings from other C Suite and board members, Revlon’s inside ownership is an incredibly high 86-87%. This number has been steady with VIRTUALLY NO insider buying or selling for 2.5 years. They didn’t sell on the drop to $4 last year and they didn’t sell on the pop to $18 earlier this year. Insiders are sitting on big losses from $REV’s days in the $20s before the pandemic. My belief is that Perelman is either holding out for a big turnaround to recoup his investment before divesting, or he is planning to take over the rest of the shares and take the company private. Either way, the probability of him continuing to hold those 46 million shares for the near term appears high. 

So we’ve got a float of around 7.5 million shares for a ‘floating market cap’ of $80-$85 million today. So far, nothing too noteworthy other than a low float, low volume stock. When evaluating short or gamma squeeze potential, I like to see a tighter supply than this and have some idea of the volume and velocity of shares movements when prices start moving. **So let’s break out those remaining 7.5 million shares and see what we find there.** 

Remember the market cap? $REV sits right in the middle of NYSE small cap territory which has it listed in the Russell 2000 and other small cap index funds where market cap requirements often start around half a billion. The familiar names of Vanguard and Blackrock hold over 1 million shares in very low turnover index and segment funds. If we pull the other lower turnover ETFs and mutual funds in to the fold, I get to around 1.3 million shares in ETFs that I categorize as ‘probably not going anywhere right now’. Under that assumption, **our 7.5 million float trims down to about 6.2 million shares that I expect to be liquid in the near term.**

Now the other institutions holding shares. **There are another 4 million shares held by institutions reporting holdings through their quarterly 13-Fs.** There are no guarantees in what these firms will do with these shares or when. However, we might be able to infer some of what we can expect to see based on history with some of the larger holders. **So let’s look at a few of those:**

* **Mittleman Investment Management:** These guys have been in $REV for years. Going back to 2018 they held as many as 3.3 million shares. They unloaded about 1 million in the 2020 pandemic sell off. But they’ve otherwise been slowly reducing their position quarter by quarter. As of the last filings effective September 30th, they held 1.397 million shares (down 72,000 from the prior quarter). In June of 2021, $REV had a run up to $18 per share and Mittleman reduced their holdings by about 300,000 in that quarter. Given the trajectory of their divesting and a similar run to $17 earlier in Q4, **I anticipate current holdings of between 1.0 and 1.1 million shares today. Price** may need to move up 50% or more from the current levels to see that accelerate. 
* **Alberta Investment Management:** Holders of 1.0-1.4 million shares going back to 2018. Their holdings have not changed at all in several quarters and include periods where the stock fell to $4 and rose to $17. Most of their holdings were acquired during a period of $20-25 per share so I don’t see any immediate evidence of a divestiture. **I have plugged them in at an assumption of 1 million shares held today that are relatively sticky without a big run up in price.** 
* **Others (Nuveen, State Street, Geode, Berylson, and others):** The larger holders in this group have generally been either steady or accumulating over the last few quarters. There are over 1 million shares held by this group today. However, I don’t feel as confident in anticipating what they may or may not do in the event of routine price action and the course of business. **I have baked in only half of these shares in my ‘probably not moving’ bucket and pulled another 500,000 from shares likely to trade in the near term.** 

**In my share bucketing, I pull out these 2.5 million shares plus the prior 1.3 million ETF shares from the active float.** So our 7.5 million float gets reduced by about 3.8 million shares to 3.7 million shares that I estimate are in play on a typical trading day. 

Realistically, the true number is likely much lower as evidenced by the average trading volume. There are other smaller funds and holders that we did not even glance at above. There are also many hundreds or even thousands of employees at Revlon that are granted RSUs, options, or hold equity through other means**. Internally registered insiders don’t report their trades or holdings to the SEC or count as closely held shares. But, they are usually held to quarterly blackout periods to promote insider trading compliance.** Those internal blackout periods, by the way, typically start a bit before the end of a fiscal quarter and run through the day after the next earnings report. **We’re in the middle of that right now and will be through early Feb.** We have no public data to quantify these share counts but it undoubtedly takes another large chunk out of what is truly ‘tradable’. The market cap of shares that are actually trading for $REV could be as low as $20-$30 million or even less. 

So we’ve got us a low float stock with an even lower ‘real float’. Cool, but there are plenty of low float stocks out there, right? So what makes $REV a retail trading hot commodity?

**1.** **$REV trades options on NYSE.** As 2021 showed us, an options market is a supercharger for price action. Most low float, low trading market cap stocks do not qualify for options trading on NYSE. $REV has BARELY maintained the required 7 million publicly held shares to continue trading options on NYSE. **My analysis suggests to me that only 2 to 3 million shares are actually functioning day to day like floating shares.** Try to find lower trading liquidity on NYSE with options contracts trading over the same range of dates and as many strike prices. I’ll save you some time… you can’t.

**2.** **The existing open interest in that options market is already a gamma time bomb.** There are about 14,000 open option contracts today with 77% of those being calls (\~10,700 contracts). But out of those open call contracts, **almost 6,500 contracts are for January 2022 (next month) and almost all of them are on near the money or out of them money strike prices**. Since we are only a few weeks away from expiration for a low volatility stock, the Delta on these contracts is very low and very little Delta hedging has taken place to date**. January 2022 has substantial open interest on calls for every strike from $12.50 all the way up to $25.** Based on current Delta, market makers only need about 45,000 shares to hedge these positions today. If the price of $REV were to go up $1, roughly an additional 25,000 shares need to be bought to hedge those open calls. **Right now, it takes several hours for 25,000 shares of $REV to trade. The price action from a sudden purchase of 25,000 shares would be huge.** The closer we get to expiration and the further up the price goes, the more delta hedging required and the vicious cycle sets off. And this is just based on open interest TODAY. The impact magnifies as traders buy and open more calls, something that could really take off if a lot of eyeballs find this post. 

Stated simply, the current options set up on $REV is a coiled spring going in to January options expiration. The gamma squeeze potential only gets larger as more short term calls are purchased and written.

So, we’ve got very low float and liquidity with an options market set up to force buying shares that will be very hard to find. That establishes that we’ve got something prone to violent price moves. But where is the exit? **Aren’t we just pumping this up to sell it to the next bag holder that made it too late to profit? That’s where point #3 comes in to solidify this as a retail gainer that isn’t built on turning your peers in to bag holders.** 

**3.** **Short interest is deceptively high and vulnerable.** Short interest sits at 1.1 million shares. That is about 15% of the ‘float’. That is high-ish, but doesn’t scream short squeeze. But as we’ve established above, a ton of floating shares are not going to be trading in the immediate term without a big price move up to coax inside and institutional sellers out of hiding. **In the immediate future, the functional short interest runs closer to 50% in my opinion.** The extremely low trading volume also means that any attempt to cover and close short positions will quickly overwhelm $REV liquidity and drive prices higher. The historical short interest changes also show most of the short interest increases and short trading volume took place in the same $10-12 range that the stock sits in today. Most short sellers are not sitting on big open profits that can wait out a price increase without some pain. In the November price run up to $17, we saw short interest decrease by 160,000 shares, which I believe was a contributor to the rapid 70% move in share price between November 2nd and November 8th. There are 1.1 million more shorts out there and the potential combination of a gamma fueled short squeeze 1-2 punch makes hoping for a reversal a more dangerous play than it would have been two months ago. **This is a much more dangerous stock to bet against than it was during past price runs.**

**What makes $REV different from other squeeze DD out there?** The volume of retail activity needed to get things moving would be substantially lower than other recent squeezes over the last year. Even low market cap stocks usually start trading with such high volumes that it takes overwhelming buying pressure to overcome the inertia of the stock price. $REV has no inertia. It is a balloon floating around silently. A few dozen small retail traders could probably materially shift the dynamics of the stock if they decided to play the stock bullish.

**When could a gamma/short driven run up happen?** The window of opportunity is likely limited to only the next few weeks and no later. As of now, we only see high open interest in the January options contracts. A sudden shift in open interest to February could extend the window of opportunity by a month.

It also has a relatively high short interest for its very low trading volume. Buying pressure could trigger a 1-2 gamma squeeze short squeeze event on the shares. This is unlikely to happen after January 21st if it has not already happened by that time.*

$REV (yes, the cosmetics company Revlon) is an extremely low hanging target for the retail-investing crowd to run with and rally to multiple times the current share price. Trading volume on this one is low, so it won’t take much to move things. Small retail investors should pay attention. The window for a price run is only for about the next 3-4 weeks based on the options market, upcoming dilution, and institutional moves. **Read on if I’ve piqued your interest:**

Let’s get the obvious out of the way. Revlon has not been doing so well over the last 5+ years. An overload of debt coupled with the pandemic limiting in person activities meant that the demand cosmetics and personal care products dropped and the company didn’t have the balance sheet or cash flow to take risks, pivot, or adapt. After a drop as low as $4 per share in November 2020, the price has been relatively stable over the last year in the $10-12 range with a few short-lived breakouts. Notably the company showed better than expected progress on its cost cutting and turnaround program in the most recent quarter, which gave it a short-lived break out to $17 that has since reverted to the same $10-$12 channel. This puts the market cap in the $500-700 million dollar range, right in the heart of small cap dixie. **Here is where it gets interesting:**

Almost all of $REV stock is owned by an eccentric gentleman named Ronald Perelman. **Perelman, a billionaire several times over, owns over 46 million of the 54 million shares outstanding.** Coupled with smaller holdings from other C Suite and board members, Revlon’s inside ownership is an incredibly high 86-87%. This number has been steady with VIRTUALLY NO insider buying or selling for 2.5 years. They didn’t sell on the drop to $4 last year and they didn’t sell on the pop to $18 earlier this year. Insiders are sitting on big losses from $REV’s days in the $20s before the pandemic. My belief is that Perelman is either holding out for a big turnaround to recoup his investment before divesting, or he is planning to take over the rest of the shares and take the company private. Either way, the probability of him continuing to hold those 46 million shares for the near term appears high. 

So we’ve got a float of around 7.5 million shares for a ‘floating market cap’ of $80-$85 million today. So far, nothing too noteworthy other than a low float, low volume stock. When evaluating short or gamma squeeze potential, I like to see a tighter supply than this and have some idea of the volume and velocity of shares movements when prices start moving. **So let’s break out those remaining 7.5 million shares and see what we find there.** 

Remember the market cap? $REV sits right in the middle of NYSE small cap territory which has it listed in the Russell 2000 and other small cap index funds where market cap requirements often start around half a billion. The familiar names of Vanguard and Blackrock hold over 1 million shares in very low turnover index and segment funds. If we pull the other lower turnover ETFs and mutual funds in to the fold, I get to around 1.3 million shares in ETFs that I categorize as ‘probably not going anywhere right now’. Under that assumption, **our 7.5 million float trims down to about 6.2 million shares that I expect to be liquid in the near term.**

Now the other institutions holding shares. **There are another 4 million shares held by institutions reporting holdings through their quarterly 13-Fs.** There are no guarantees in what these firms will do with these shares or when. However, we might be able to infer some of what we can expect to see based on history with some of the larger holders. **So let’s look at a few of those:**

* **Mittleman Investment Management:** These guys have been in $REV for years. Going back to 2018 they held as many as 3.3 million shares. They unloaded about 1 million in the 2020 pandemic sell off. But they’ve otherwise been slowly reducing their position quarter by quarter. As of the last filings effective September 30th, they held 1.397 million shares (down 72,000 from the prior quarter). In June of 2021, $REV had a run up to $18 per share and Mittleman reduced their holdings by about 300,000 in that quarter. Given the trajectory of their divesting and a similar run to $17 earlier in Q4, **I anticipate current holdings of between 1.0 and 1.1 million shares today. Price** may need to move up 50% or more from the current levels to see that accelerate. 
* **Alberta Investment Management:** Holders of 1.0-1.4 million shares going back to 2018. Their holdings have not changed at all in several quarters and include periods where the stock fell to $4 and rose to $17. Most of their holdings were acquired during a period of $20-25 per share so I don’t see any immediate evidence of a divestiture. **I have plugged them in at an assumption of 1 million shares held today that are relatively sticky without a big run up in price.** 
* **Others (Nuveen, State Street, Geode, Berylson, and others):** The larger holders in this group have generally been either steady or accumulating over the last few quarters. There are over 1 million shares held by this group today. However, I don’t feel as confident in anticipating what they may or may not do in the event of routine price action and the course of business. **I have baked in only half of these shares in my ‘probably not moving’ bucket and pulled another 500,000 from shares likely to trade in the near term.** 

**In my share bucketing, I pull out these 2.5 million shares plus the prior 1.3 million ETF shares from the active float.** So our 7.5 million float gets reduced by about 3.8 million shares to 3.7 million shares that I estimate are in play on a typical trading day. 

Realistically, the true number is likely much lower as evidenced by the average trading volume. There are other smaller funds and holders that we did not even glance at above. There are also many hundreds or even thousands of employees at Revlon that are granted RSUs, options, or hold equity through other means**. Internally registered insiders don’t report their trades or holdings to the SEC or count as closely held shares. But, they are usually held to quarterly blackout periods to promote insider trading compliance.** Those internal blackout periods, by the way, typically start a bit before the end of a fiscal quarter and run through the day after the next earnings report. **We’re in the middle of that right now and will be through early Feb.** We have no public data to quantify these share counts but it undoubtedly takes another large chunk out of what is truly ‘tradable’. The market cap of shares that are actually trading for $REV could be as low as $20-$30 million or even less. 

So we’ve got us a low float stock with an even lower ‘real float’. Cool, but there are plenty of low float stocks out there, right? So what makes $REV a retail trading hot commodity?

**1.** **$REV trades options on NYSE.** As 2021 showed us, an options market is a supercharger for price action. Most low float, low trading market cap stocks do not qualify for options trading on NYSE. $REV has BARELY maintained the required 7 million publicly held shares to continue trading options on NYSE. **My analysis suggests to me that only 2 to 3 million shares are actually functioning day to day like floating shares.** Try to find lower trading liquidity on NYSE with options contracts trading over the same range of dates and as many strike prices. I’ll save you some time… you can’t.

**2.** **The existing open interest in that options market is already a gamma time bomb.** There are about 14,000 open option contracts today with 77% of those being calls (\~10,700 contracts). But out of those open call contracts, **almost 6,500 contracts are for January 2022 (next month) and almost all of them are on near the money or out of them money strike prices**. Since we are only a few weeks away from expiration for a low volatility stock, the Delta on these contracts is very low and very little Delta hedging has taken place to date**. January 2022 has substantial open interest on calls for every strike from $12.50 all the way up to $25.** Based on current Delta, market makers only need about 45,000 shares to hedge these positions today. If the price of $REV were to go up $1, roughly an additional 25,000 shares need to be bought to hedge those open calls. **Right now, it takes several hours for 25,000 shares of $REV to trade. The price action from a sudden purchase of 25,000 shares would be huge.** The closer we get to expiration and the further up the price goes, the more delta hedging required and the vicious cycle sets off. And this is just based on open interest TODAY. The impact magnifies as traders buy and open more calls, something that could really take off if a lot of eyeballs find this post. 

Stated simply, the current options set up on $REV is a coiled spring going in to January options expiration. The gamma squeeze potential only gets larger as more short term calls are purchased and written.

So, we’ve got very low float and liquidity with an options market set up to force buying shares that will be very hard to find. That establishes that we’ve got something prone to violent price moves. But where is the exit? **Aren’t we just pumping this up to sell it to the next bag holder that made it too late to profit? That’s where point #3 comes in to solidify this as a retail gainer that isn’t built on turning your peers in to bag holders.** 

**3.** **Short interest is deceptively high and vulnerable.** Short interest sits at 1.1 million shares. That is about 15% of the ‘float’. That is high-ish, but doesn’t scream short squeeze. But as we’ve established above, a ton of floating shares are not going to be trading in the immediate term without a big price move up to coax inside and institutional sellers out of hiding. **In the immediate future, the functional short interest runs closer to 50% in my opinion.** The extremely low trading volume also means that any attempt to cover and close short positions will quickly overwhelm $REV liquidity and drive prices higher. The historical short interest changes also show most of the short interest increases and short trading volume took place in the same $10-12 range that the stock sits in today. Most short sellers are not sitting on big open profits that can wait out a price increase without some pain. In the November price run up to $17, we saw short interest decrease by 160,000 shares, which I believe was a contributor to the rapid 70% move in share price between November 2nd and November 8th. There are 1.1 million more shorts out there and the potential combination of a gamma fueled short squeeze 1-2 punch makes hoping for a reversal a more dangerous play than it would have been two months ago. **This is a much more dangerous stock to bet against than it was during past price runs.**

**What makes $REV different from other squeeze DD out there?** The volume of retail activity needed to get things moving would be substantially lower than other recent squeezes over the last year. Even low market cap stocks usually start trading with such high volumes that it takes overwhelming buying pressure to overcome the inertia of the stock price. $REV has no inertia. It is a balloon floating around silently. A few dozen small retail traders could probably materially shift the dynamics of the stock if they decided to play the stock bullish. GME, AMC, and others took tens or hundreds of thousands of retail players to join the fray. 

**When could a gamma/short driven run up happen?** The window of opportunity is likely limited to only the next few weeks and no later. As of now, we only see high open interest in the January options contracts. A sudden shift in open interest to February could extend the window of opportunity by a month. But, there are no March or April contracts and everything from May onward has minimal activity so far. If you read the last 10-Q filing, you will also note that March 2022 has a huge vesting of RSUs to employees and executives. It looks to likely be somewhere in the 500k to 1M share range, which will push more shares in to the trading float as well. As we go further out in the future there is also less certainty around the insiders and large funds holding remaining steady and that tight ‘real float’ is less and less likely to continue as you look further in to the future.

**What is the potential price move in this one**? It is always hard to say for sure. The current options setup suggests that $25 is not out of the question in a gamma/short combo punch. If there is a big uptake in awareness, things can always get carried away so I never put a hard limit on the upper end of a squeeze driven price move. However, I expect prices over $20-$25 to start to bring more shares to market by institutional holders. 

**What has to happen for this price movement to trigger?** There are no guarantees, but inflows of money in to common shares AND January 2022 calls in the $10 to $15 range seem to be where this one is the most vulnerable. If upward price movement starts, commons + calls strikes above $15 all the way up to the highest strike of $30 would be required to see the highest possible price movement and give the highest probability of short covering happening before the January option expiration on the Jan 21st. 

**Is the underlying stock worth anything?It could organically move higher on its own without the influence of the options and short markets. The last earnings release was the catalyst that set off the last rally to $17 on better progress than expected on their turnaround and cost cutting plans.

But out of those open call contracts, **almost 6,500 contracts are for January 2022 (next month) and almost all of them are on near the money or out of them money strike prices**. Since we are only a few weeks away from expiration for a low volatility stock, the Delta on these contracts is very low and very little Delta hedging has taken place to date**. January 2022 has substantial open interest on calls for every strike from $12.50 all the way up to $25.** Based on current Delta, market makers only need about 45,000 shares to hedge these positions today. If the price of $REV were to go up $1, roughly an additional 25,000 shares need to be bought to hedge those open calls. **Right now, it takes several hours for 25,000 shares of $REV to trade. The price action from a sudden purchase of 25,000 shares would be huge.** The closer we get to expiration and the further up the price goes, the more delta hedging required and the vicious cycle sets off. And this is just based on open interest TODAY. The impact magnifies as traders buy and open more calls, something that could really take off if a lot of eyeballs find this post. 

Stated simply, the current options set up on $REV is a coiled spring going in to January options expiration. The gamma squeeze potential only gets larger as more short term calls are purchased and written.

So, we’ve got very low float and liquidity with an options market set up to force buying shares that will be very hard to find. That establishes that we’ve got something prone to violent price moves. But where is the exit? **Aren’t we just pumping this up to sell it to the next bag holder that made it too late to profit? That’s where point #3 comes in to solidify this as a retail gainer that isn’t built on turning your peers in to bag holders.** 

**3.** **Short interest is deceptively high and vulnerable.** Short interest sits at 1.1 million shares. That is about 15% of the ‘float’. That is high-ish, but doesn’t scream short squeeze. But as we’ve established above, a ton of floating shares are not going to be trading in the immediate term without a big price move up to coax inside and institutional sellers out of hiding. **In the immediate future, the functional short interest runs closer to 50% in my opinion.** The extremely low trading volume also means that any attempt to cover and close short positions will quickly overwhelm $REV liquidity and drive prices higher. The historical short interest changes also show most of the short interest increases and short trading volume took place in the same $10-12 range that the stock sits in today. Most short sellers are not sitting on big open profits that can wait out a price increase without some pain. In the November price run up to $17, we saw short interest decrease by 160,000 shares, which I believe was a contributor to the rapid 70% move in share price between November 2nd and November 8th. There are 1.1 million more shorts out there and the potential combination of a gamma fueled short squeeze 1-2 punch makes hoping for a reversal a more dangerous play than it would have been two months ago. **This is a much more dangerous stock to bet against than it was during past price runs.**

**What makes $REV different from other squeeze DD out there?** The volume of retail activity needed to get things moving would be substantially lower than other recent squeezes over the last year. Even low market cap stocks usually start trading with such high volumes that it takes overwhelming buying pressure to overcome the inertia of the stock price. $REV has no inertia. It is a balloon floating around silently. A few dozen small retail traders could probably materially shift the dynamics of the stock if they decided to play the stock bullish. GME, AMC, and others took tens or hundreds of thousands of retail players to join the fray. 

**When could a gamma/short driven run up happen?** The window of opportunity is likely limited to only the next few weeks and no later. As of now, we only see high open interest in the January options contracts. A sudden shift in open interest to February could extend the window of opportunity by a month. But, there are no March or April contracts and everything from May onward has minimal activity so far. If you read the last 10-Q filing, you will also note that March 2022 has a huge vesting of RSUs to employees and executives. It looks to likely be somewhere in the 500k to 1M share range, which will push more shares in to the trading float as well. As we go further out in the future there is also less certainty around the insiders and large funds holding remaining steady and that tight ‘real float’ is less and less likely to continue as you look further in to the future.

**What is the potential price move in this one**? It is always hard to say for sure. The current options setup suggests that $25 is not out of the question in a gamma/short combo punch. If there is a big uptake in awareness, things can always get carried away so I never put a hard limit on the upper end of a squeeze driven price move. However, I expect prices over $20-$25 to start to bring more shares to market by institutional holders. 

**What has to happen for this price movement to trigger?** There are no guarantees, but inflows of money in to common shares AND January 2022 calls in the $10 to $15 range seem to be where this one is the most vulnerable. If upward price movement starts, commons + calls strikes above $15 all the way up to the highest strike of $30 would be required to see the highest possible price movement and give the highest probability of short covering happening before the January option expiration on the Jan 21st. 

**Is the underlying stock worth anything?It could organically move higher on its own without the influence of the options and short markets. The last earnings release was the catalyst that set off the last rally to $17 on better progress than expected on their turnaround and cost cutting plans. Perform your own DD to research the longer-term future of the company.

Always do your own DD. This represents the findings of my own personal research and is not financial advice.

**Disclosure:** I liked what I found in my personal research. I added a few commons and a big bag of Jan calls today: https://imgur.com/a/xsS7LWF

Fellow smooth brains,

Many don't see it yet, but the catalyst for a massive shortsqueeze, possibly the biggest one yet, and one that affects multiple stocks, is coming within the next few weeks. This DD will explain what it is, how it affects AMC, GME &amp; Other Stocks, and how we can profit from this knowledge. This DD is strictly based on facts and numbers. However, early data / studies had to be used, because things are progressing rapidly. If we would wait for peer reviews etc. of certain data, it would all be over and we would still be waiting. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Intro**

It has been a hard couple of weeks for many stock holders. Even some of the most battle hardened smooth brains, including me, got a bit nervous when the freefall in many of our most favorite stocks started. The good news is, that this drop is part of the setup for a massive shortsqueeze. Let me explain why.

&amp;#x200B;

**The catalyst**

Massive drops in different stocks happened when the media started hyping and spreading fear about the new Covid-19 variant, Omicron. Big and small players started to short certain (already heavily shorted) stocks even more. Their thinking is that this variant will most likely cause further lockdowns, and possibly could be the nail in the coffin for some of the companies that are most affected by the pandemic. **They are dead wrong**. Omicron is the end of the pandemic. It is a natural vaccine for covid and it will be the catalyst for multiple massive short squeezes. Let me present the data and explain everything.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Omicron Variant**

The omicron variant of SARS COVID-19 is a different beast. Extremely contagious, even for vaccinated and boosted people. Spreading like wildfire. Bad right? No, good. End of the pandemic good.

Why you ask? Because according to all knowledge and data we have, it has four distinct properties which make it the best thing that could ever happen in this pandemic (in the big picture). We will look at each of these four things individually, I will provide proof they they are indeed facts, and then we will draw our conclusions at the end:

  


**Property 1: It is more contagious and spreads faster than any other variant we ever had**

&amp;#x200B;

**Property 2: It causes very mild symptoms and it puts much less people into the hospital. People that do need to go to the hospital because of it, can leave much earlier on average than with other variants. Less ventilators are needed.**

Early studies are underway, but the virus spreads so rapidly that once the studies are finished, it will already be too late for them to be useful. The most useful thing we can do is compare cases, deaths, and emergency care utilization etc. in countries where Omicron is the prevalent variant. The UK is perfect for this. Look at how many cases and how many deaths they have

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Property 3: It replaces the deadlier variants of Covid-19 (Mostly Delta)**

Omicron, the much less harmful variant, actually replaces delta!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

What omicron basically does is it infects many, many people, fast. It causes mostly mild symptoms in exchange for immunity against covid-19. Then it is killed by the immune system. It also replaces the other variants. See where this is going? It is like a natural vaccine which spreads by itself and immunizes most of the world population, rapidly, without causing too many bad cases or deaths.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**A little bit of history**

Why are you so sure this will actually happen? You ask. 

Well, we have very, very good early data, and also because it already happened in the last real pandemic we had. The spanish flu.  


From wikipedia:  
“End of the pandemic

By 1920, the virus that caused the pandemic became much less deadly and caused only ordinary seasonal flu.”

And guess what, even the timing is similar - roughly two years.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The juicy stuff**

The pandemic short thesis is wrong. All the companies that were shorted because of the pandemic or the omicron variant - there is no reason for that anymore. The pandemic will be over, and an endemic will start once omicron has burned through the population, which will take only a few weeks, according to the early data we have.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR - Positions**

All available data suggests that omicron will be the cause for the end of the pandemic. Omicron will burn through the world population, causing mostly harmless, flu-like symptoms and provide immunity against more harmful variants. It will replace the more deadly variants. We will most likely be back to pretty much regular life, within a few weeks, months at most. The pandemic and the omicron short thesis are therefore not valid anymore. And there is no reason for the heavy shorting of certain companies. The shorts will get burned hard once the media and the masses realizes this, and stocks like GME or AMC will rocket. 

Positions:  
GME and AMC calls (End of Jan / start of Feb) &amp; shares

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Final word:**

My sincere and heartfelt condolences to everybody who has lost family or friends in this pandemic. Even though the Omicron variant is good news in the big picture, there will still people die from it, and every single death is a tragedy. 

Fuck this pandemic.","The beginning of the end - The catalyst for massive short squeezes in AMC, GME and other companies that are heavily affected by the pandemic, is coming within the next few weeks. DETAILED RESEARCH &amp; DD",1,1,"The beginning of the end - The catalyst for massive short squeezes in AMC, GME and other companies that are heavily affected by the pandemic, is coming within the next few weeks. DETAILED RESEARCH &amp; DD TLDR at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

Fellow smooth brains,

Many don't see it yet, but the catalyst for a massive shortsqueeze, possibly the biggest one yet, and one that affects multiple stocks, is coming within the next few weeks. This DD will explain what it is, how it affects AMC, GME &amp; Other Stocks, and how we can profit from this knowledge. This DD is strictly based on facts and numbers. However, early data / studies had to be used, because things are progressing rapidly. If we would wait for peer reviews etc. of certain data, it would all be over and we would still be waiting. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Intro**

It has been a hard couple of weeks for many stock holders. Even some of the most battle hardened smooth brains, including me, got a bit nervous when the freefall in many of our most favorite stocks started. The good news is, that this drop is part of the setup for a massive shortsqueeze. Let me explain why.

&amp;#x200B;

**The catalyst**

Massive drops in different stocks happened when the media started hyping and spreading fear about the new Covid-19 variant, Omicron. Big and small players started to short certain (already heavily shorted) stocks even more. Their thinking is that this variant will most likely cause further lockdowns, and possibly could be the nail in the coffin for some of the companies that are most affected by the pandemic. **They are dead wrong**. Omicron is the end of the pandemic. It is a natural vaccine for covid and it will be the catalyst for multiple massive short squeezes. Let me present the data and explain everything.

For those of you getting your short interest information from Fintel, Fintel sources their data from Capital IQ and says they update twice a month, which happens to be tomorrow for the next update. Im willing to bet Fintel will report this high SI tomorrow night.

Also, on yahoo finance, the Shares short is being reported as 4.18 and the Free float is being reported as 2.45M as well. Although the Shares Outstanding calculation has changed since Aug 13th, since the data sources like Capital IQ have updated their Float calculation to take out Bath and Body Works' 80M stake out of the free float. The Short % of Float number is just reflective of the data on August 13th, and the Float number has changed since then. Next short interest reporting date is tomorrow. It should be updated to reflect current float calculations then.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently posted a $WISH YOLO: I have secured three personal loans and YOLO'd $80k into Dec '22 $8/$15 Call Debit Spreads (post link: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pioi79/80k\_wish\_leaps\_yolo\_funding\_secured\_from\_3/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pioi79/80k_wish_leaps_yolo_funding_secured_from_3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)).

&amp;#x200B;

Why am I so bullish on a supposedly shit company? Wish seems to have major problems:

* Cheap product quality
* Slow delivery times
* User acquisition issues
* Customer retention issues
* Falling revenue growth

The problems, at first glance, seem very serious. At the end of the day, why invest in a growth company that has stopped growing?

&amp;#x200B;

I was fully aware of all the above problems when I decided to YOLO with bank dolo. In my opinion, Wish has only one problem that will solve ALL of its problems if addressed. If Wish can improve product quality, by weaning itself off cheap Chinese products and choosing merchants that offer popular brands, all other problems will be solved, excluding slow delivery times. A better product range will increase user acquisition and retention which, in turn, will increase revenue growth.

&amp;#x200B;

As for slow delivery times, Wish's Logistics revenue increased 126% in the second quarter and slow delivery times are no longer a common complaint - which confirms delivery times have improved, and continue to improve as Wish expands its Logistics operations. Furthermore, the Wish Local feature offers same day pick-up.

&amp;#x200B;

I would also urge investors to stop comparing Wish to an Amazon or an Alibaba. I compare Wish to eBay, which leads me to believe Wish is grossly undervalued when comparing market caps. Why compare Wish to eBay? Four years ago, I bought a black leather belt from eBay; I recently purchased that same belt from Wish: Wish is more similar to eBay than Amazon or Alibaba. And even if Wish is only HALF an eBay, it means Wish's stock price may 5x according to market caps.

&amp;#x200B;

I also love how management is aware of and responsive to the two main pain points, low product quality and slow delivery times, and have decided to continue addressing these issues going forward. And to help navigate the turnaround, Wish has a strong cash position, which means they should not require additional equity capital (i.e. share dilution).

&amp;#x200B;

It is also worth mentioning that Wish will most likely not moon or short squeeze. I do believe, however, that it will 2x, or even 3x, by end of next year: notice how my short leg is only $15 and not something ridiculous like $50. Improving product quality and delivery times, in my opinion, will be game changers that should reignite investor interest.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, why did I invest now and not later? The stock market is forward-looking. The market will not wait for Wish to be profitable before the stock price starts to increase; rather, the market is merely waiting for signs of a return to profitability. Improving product quality will be that sign.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, just thought I'd share my rationale for my investment decision.

As for slow delivery times, Wish's Logistics revenue increased 126% in the second quarter and slow delivery times are no longer a common complaint - which confirms delivery times have improved, and continue to improve as Wish expands its Logistics operations. Furthermore, the Wish Local feature offers same day pick-up.

&amp;#x200B;

I would also urge investors to stop comparing Wish to an Amazon or an Alibaba. I compare Wish to eBay, which leads me to believe Wish is grossly undervalued when comparing market caps. Why compare Wish to eBay? Four years ago, I bought a black leather belt from eBay; I recently purchased that same belt from Wish: Wish is more similar to eBay than Amazon or Alibaba. And even if Wish is only HALF an eBay, it means Wish's stock price may 5x according to market caps.

&amp;#x200B;

I also love how management is aware of and responsive to the two main pain points, low product quality and slow delivery times, and have decided to continue addressing these issues going forward. And to help navigate the turnaround, Wish has a strong cash position, which means they should not require additional equity capital (i.e. share dilution).

&amp;#x200B;

It is also worth mentioning that Wish will most likely not moon or short squeeze. I do believe, however, that it will 2x, or even 3x, by end of next year: notice how my short leg is only $15 and not something ridiculous like $50. Improving product quality and delivery times, in my opinion, will be game changers that should reignite investor interest.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, why did I invest now and not later? The stock market is forward-looking. The market will not wait for Wish to be profitable before the stock price starts to increase; rather, the market is merely waiting for signs of a return to profitability. Improving product quality will be that sign.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, just thought I'd share my rationale for my investment decision.

As anyone with a wife and a wife's bull knows by now, VIAC completed an offering at $85 before being decimated by the liquidation of Archepelagos and its leader Billy Zane.  Fine.  Me and a whole bunch of value buyers got into shares and/or options in the low 40's - at around 10 P/E and with exciting streaming prospects that got Bill's Wang interested in the first place, a retracement was reasonable to expect, right?  Unfortunately, it has been range-bound and bleeding ever since, with educated investors and lovers of Viacom (owners  of **Spongebob**, to be clear) getting spit-roasted.  As with the tale of GME, the tragic past and present of VIAC both come down to abuse of power by Hedge Funds and Market Makers:

* **The Liquidation** \- The initial drop is pretty much a paragon of everything wrong with HFs: take bets you can't support financially, get margin called, fuck over everyone who was vouching for you with no consequence.  Even worse, arguably, is Goldman and MS dipping out with **inside knowledge** before their counterparts, like Credit Suisse and Nomura, were able to get out.  Even even worse is the fact that, even after all major firms except Nomura clearly announced they had no more exposure to VIAC, we continue to see major dumps of VIAC stock every day the second we see a decent bump in price - like this mysterious gem from Wednesday morning:

If you don’t care about supply and demand economics, just stop reading, buy some fucking $RIDE and buckle up.  It’s about to get wild. 


1. Russell reconstitution will cause $75 - $115M in forced purchases by ETF’s that follow Russell indexes.  This will happen Friday - next week. 


2. Few other stocks have been as beaten down by media / short sellers over the last 6 months.  Granted $RIDE has had its fair share of hiccups, but GM owns 7.5% of the company, WKHS owns 10%, they have a 6 million sq foot production facility, manufacturing equipment, and vehicles. (List goes on and on) 


3. $RIDE has had a complete whirlwind the last 12 months, SPAC, 🚀 to $30, down to $13, 🚀 back to $30, down to $7, and here we are today at $11.  Anybody that is left holding today has no incentive to sell to the index. People continuing to hold at this point have been through the ringer, and they’re 3 months out from production.  Why would they sell now?  Aside from CEO and forward progress with vehicles, nothing fundamentally has changed since when it was hitting 20’s and 30’s earlier this year and late 2020. In fact they’re closer to production, with Betas and crash test rating approvals.  Again, why sell now?  When ETF’s are forced to purchase to follow the index, they have to buy those shares from someone willing to sell.  If nobody wants to sell and wants to see this through, we’re going to see fireworks. 🚀🚀


4. Undervalued compared to other EV companies that are not nearly as far along. NKLA $6B? Canoo $2B no facility? Rivian $70B pre revenue?… if $Ride captures a 10% valuation of Rivian, we’re looking at an SP of $40 


5. High valuation going into the index ranking day ~ $1.8B.  This is a decently new phenomenon with large companies getting added to the index as opposed to growing up into the index (I.e. WKHS).  This is because SPAC’s aren’t included in the index until they have completed their mergers. 

Other SPAC’s are also getting added in, also at high valuations, but out of all the others, $RIDE seems to be most undervalued with the strongest base of support.  Why sell now?… 

Some others that are getting rolled in, and why they don’t make sense: 
RIOT / MARA: heavily tied to the price of “alt currencies”.  If the index throws this out of whack compared to “alt currency” price, people will sell 

CLOV: $34M of revenue &amp; $4B valuation?  Overvalued? 

SKLZ: Has anyone used this platform to make money?  It preys on low income gambling addictions. 

GOEV: facility?… production…? 

Nikola: overvalued…? Production?… facility / timeline?


Long story short, this slingshot seemed primed and ready to rocket back up to $30. Throw short interest on top of all this, and we can have a very exciting next couple of weeks ahead of us. Plus all the long term action of getting in early

Why would they sell now?  Aside from CEO and forward progress with vehicles, nothing fundamentally has changed since when it was hitting 20’s and 30’s earlier this year and late 2020. In fact they’re closer to production, with Betas and crash test rating approvals.  Again, why sell now?  When ETF’s are forced to purchase to follow the index, they have to buy those shares from someone willing to sell.  If nobody wants to sell and wants to see this through, we’re going to see fireworks. 🚀🚀


4. Undervalued compared to other EV companies that are not nearly as far along. NKLA $6B? Canoo $2B no facility? Rivian $70B pre revenue?… if $Ride captures a 10% valuation of Rivian, we’re looking at an SP of $40 


5. High valuation going into the index ranking day ~ $1.8B.  This is a decently new phenomenon with large companies getting added to the index as opposed to growing up into the index (I.e. WKHS).  This is because SPAC’s aren’t included in the index until they have completed their mergers. 

Other SPAC’s are also getting added in, also at high valuations, but out of all the others, $RIDE seems to be most undervalued with the strongest base of support.  Why sell now?… 

Some others that are getting rolled in, and why they don’t make sense: 
RIOT / MARA: heavily tied to the price of “alt currencies”.  If the index throws this out of whack compared to “alt currency” price, people will sell 

CLOV: $34M of revenue &amp; $4B valuation?  Overvalued? 

SKLZ: Has anyone used this platform to make money?  It preys on low income gambling addictions. 

GOEV: facility?… production…? 

Nikola: overvalued…? Production?… facility / timeline?


Long story short, this slingshot seemed primed and ready to rocket back up to $30. Throw short interest on top of all this, and we can have a very exciting next couple of weeks ahead of us. Plus all the long term action of getting in early

So interesting that I dare predict a short squeeze could happen as early as tomorrow. The magnitude of the squeeze is something that will be hard to tell, and could be dependent on factors currently unknown to us, but it will definitely be an early christmas present for many. 

**What does it mean to be listed on the threshold list and what happens on the 13th consecutive day?**

The Regulation SHO Threshold Security List was created by the SEC in 2005 to reduce naked short selling. Stocks appear on this list when at least 0.5% of shares outstanding failed to be settled for 5 consecutive days or more. If a stock is on the list for 13 consecutive trading days, participants will be forced to close any settlement failures (a.k.a cover the naked shorts).

**Is GME on the threshold list?**

You bet. 12 consecutive trading days starting from 8th December 2020. Quick maths mean the 13th consecutive day would fall on 24th December 2020. Shorts will be forced to cover tomorrow basically.

**Has this happened before?**

Yes. 12 consecutive days starting from 22 September 2020. Quick maths mean the 13th consecutive day fell on 8th October 2020.

**So there will be squeeze tomorrow? By how much?**

I am not a prophet but I am confident a squeeze will happen tomorrow. How much would be up to your own conclusion. All I can say is that back in October, almost everyone and their wives' boyfriend were bearish on GME other than the few OGs we have here. Ryan Cohen only had a 9% stake, GME gang and their theories were laughed off. Shorts were able to cover and close their naked shorts stealthily and without much trouble. 

This time round, Cohen upped his stake to 13%. WSB Capital has entered the foray with approximately 5% stake, which will probably be watered down to 2.5% of diamond hands stake.  Senvest Management has entered with a 5% stake as well. Hedgeye with 90k twitter followers sets a PT of $50 for GME. Some big player has been buying lots of GME shares for the past 2 days. 30M and 25M volume respectively. There are still 68M shares short at the moment. The market closes early tomorrow at 1pm. Shorts will have to buy a shitload amount of shares in half a trading day. Don't forget, GME is attracting a lot of attention from FOMOs and boomers with the Hedgeye tweet. Shorts will have to compete with all these buyers to cover. True available float should be much lower this time round with more big players in, and retail investors knowing about the potential short squeeze, and most importantly pure autistic energy.

New short interest data released on Friday calls for an updated post. 

 (*Read my previous post for background info)*

&amp;#x200B;

 **I liked these stocks because they have the following characteristics:**

1. high short interest, leading to short sellers *forced* buying -&gt; short covering rallies/squeezes
2. in a hot industry that the market's perception has fundamentally changed on recently -&gt; Solar 
3. upcoming catalyst, usually earnings

&amp;#x200B;

* **JKS** price 9/30: $40 ,  Short interest 9/30 - 17.5% (down from 25%)

JKS has since rallied to $63, and I would estimate SI to be around 10% currently. In the run-up to a perceived Biden victory it surely has more upside left, but not enough forced buying (short covering) to roll over my October 16th calls into Novembers, especially with IV so expensive. I do think the stock will hit $80 but with calls you probably won't get paid enough.

&amp;#x200B;

* **SPWR** price 9/30:  $13 , Short interest 9/30 - 47% (up from 42%)

SPWR has rallied to $17.50, and during the stock's run-up from $10 to $13, number of shares short increased - pretty favourable as more shorts will be forced to cover when the inevitable rally occurs. 

SPWR reports earnings on Nov3rd/ Nov4th, so you can either play the run-up to earnings or the post earnings short squeeze, or both. I'm playing both. I'll post in the comments my earnings predictions sometime later this week.

***SPWR Picks:*** OCT23TH 19C @ $1, OCT30TH 20C @ $1, NOV13TH 26C @ 74c

\- Due to RH's bug of settling an early assignment with an exercise the next day, you will effectively lose any buying power until the end of the next trading day. You will not be able to close your position by increasing the limit price more than the max loss/spread width.

\- If holding a spread through expiry and it is ITM (both legs), if RH is unable to close the position due to  less liquid option market and you don't have enough buying power to exercise **ALL OF THE LONG LEGS**, it will end up blowing up your account (multiple times of the spread's max loss) as your short legs will all get exercised and your long legs will not be exercised despite being ITM. This is specially applicable in case of debit spreads (which incurs max profit if expiring in the money).

**Apologies for the long post, but I urge anyone who is considering trading spreads or is actively doing so on Robinhood, to give this a read, as you may be caught off guard with this terrifying bug that could wreck your finances. To my fellow autists who don't know what spreads are, and only buy FDs, you may give this a pass.**

The past few days has been an emotional roller coaster, to say the least. But luckily I managed to get out of the dumpster fire relatively unscathed (albeit with a loss of $6k, which I am solely responsible for). I will give you a brief overview of what happened without going too much into the details:

\- Opened up a 14DTE position of a bear call (credit) spread, with 100 contracts, credit of 4k, max loss of 6k. Won't go into details, but to give a brief idea, underlying was a company that looked to be doomed at that with fraud allegations on the company and the CEO, and the CEO had to resign. Strikes were opened significantly OTM so the risk seemed very less.

\- Within a couple of days, despite a slew of bad news and media coverage, the underlying went up like crazy. Nobody in their rational mind could understand why. I guess that's the risk that I had ignored (trading a meme stock that has a mind of it's own). Long story short, 4DTE, my spread was deep in the money (like 70-80 delta). I still didn't close my position at a loss because I thought this was merely a short squeeze and would end soon. Oh boy, was I so wrong.

\- At the end of the day, I had been assigned 1/100 contracts. I have been trading spreads for some time now, and usually close early with a profit or loss. This is the first time I had gotten assigned (like ever). I thought that RH would exercise one of my long legs in response, but it didn't. Instead, I manually queued up an exercise for the next day as it was after hours. This assignment led to a short position of around 3k, and I had enough buying power to cover it, so it didn't lead to an account deficit or margin call.

\- Next day 3 DTE, my exercise went through.Tried closing my position at 95% max loss. Order didn't get filled. Fortunately, didn't get assigned after hours.

\- Next day, 2DTE, I decided I had had enough and opened a buy to close order for max loss. My order was only partially filled, with only 10/99 contracts closed. After hours, I was assigned 65 contracts (out of the remaining 89). This time, it was a margin call of 200k+. I didn't have buying power to cover it. RH didn't exercise my long legs this time either. I was super anxious and mailed RH support regarding this issue. This looked eerily similar to the Alexander Kearns story. Anyways, queued up an exercise for the 65 contracts to cover the margin call.

\- Next day, 1 DTE, exercise went through. I held 24 positions. Seemed like the options were very illequid  as even my max loss buy to close wasn't going through. I tried entering a higher limit price (more than the max loss), but RH wouldn't let me. Later I got to know from the support (who took until the end of the next trading day to get back), who confirmed that this is indeed a **bug with Robinhood where your buying power isn't restored even if you cover your margin call until the next trading day**. After hours, i got assigned another 10 contracts. Another margin call. As expected, no auto exercise from RH again. Margin called again. Queued up another exercise for 10 contracts.

\- Expiry day. With 14 contracts remaining and the margin call covered, I put 2 and 2 together that if I couldn't close my position by EOD, I would end up losing more than the max loss because RH wouldn't exercise my contracts due to the lack of buying power, despite it being way ITM. So essentially, my long leg would expire worthless, and because my short strike being around $7 ITM, I would end up losing $7\*1400 = $9800 (if I had to cover my short position after the weekend, assuming the stock opened at the same price). Thats a total loss of $15800 if you take the loss of the spread into account. Tried to close at max loss again, order won't go through after multiple hours. Tried increasing limit price, RH wouldn't let me due to the bug described above. Frantically tried contacting the support over twitter/email, but no one reached out. I had RH gold, but didn't enable margin. Turned it on, and surpisingly, my margin was shown negative (lol, what's even the point of this app when it's all bugs).

This is how it looked like:

 **Finally, as a last ditch effort, I liquidated about 90% of my portfolio to cover for an exercise of my 14 remaining long positions. Shitty thing to do, but had to be done. EOD, the 14 short positions were exercised. I was relieved that this ordeal was over.**

Lessons learnt:

\- I'm done with RH. With such a shitty support, if anything goes wrong, you are left with your d\*\*k in your hand. Other platforms may not be free but it is well worth the peace of mind. I'm considering between TDA/Fidelity, any suggestions are welcome.

\- Don't trade meme stocks. It's literally murphy's law with those.

\- Close your spreads early, regardless of a potential loss. Always remember that ""Markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent"". I had to learn this the hard way.

The term ""short interest"" has been thrown around a lot in recent times. Wanted to contribute by giving creating a [Webapp](http://short-o-meter.herokuapp.com/) that provides more transparency to the short interest of any given stock listed in the US markets.

Daily short volume % can be used as a gauge as to the level of shorting that is being done on a stock on any single day. Websites such as [shortvolumes.com](https://shortvolumes.com/) or [stickgrid.io](https://stickgrid.io/) provide short volume % that do not tell the full picture of what is going on. For instance, [shortvolumes.com](https://shortvolumes.com/) do not account for NYSE data, while [stockgrid.io](https://stockgrid.io/) ONLY accounts for FINRA data when providing that short volume figures.

This web app aims to improve transparency within this area. It automates the process of retrieving daily short volume reports from the various US Equity Markets (e.g. NYSE, NASDAQ, CBOE/BATS, and trades reported to FINRA TRFs), and breakdowns all the data clearly for you to see.

Note: **The figures here should account for** [**\~75% of daily trading volume on average**](https://www.cboe.com/us/equities/market_share/market/) **for non-Nasdaq heavy stocks. Data will be automatically updated when the exchanges upload their short sale volume data into their respective FTP/Databases. For guidance, FINRA &amp; Nasdaq updates their data no later than 6:00:00pm ET, while the rest of the exchanges will typically do so no later than 9:00:00pm ET of the same day on the relevant trade date. Nasdaq (Q) data, which usually accounts for** [**\~20% of total market volume for all U.S. Equities**](https://www.cboe.com/us/equities/market_share/market/)**, is not included here as it requires a** [**distributor fee**](http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=DPUSdata#shortsale)**. Only data prior to August 1, 2010 for Nasdaq (Q) is available. Remaining exchanges \[MEMX (U), IEX (V), MIAX (H) &amp; LTSE (L)\] which usually accounts for** [**\~5% of total market volume for all U.S. Equities**](https://www.cboe.com/us/equities/market_share/market/) **are not included here similarly as I am not able to find their data through open-source channels.**

Sample interpretation of visualizations:

[There is a total of 1.579 million shares of GME traded on 9th July 2021. However, there is only a total of 1.25 million + shares \(420k + 835k\) accounted for as information from the Nasdaq \(Q\) data is not available as mentioned above.

The term ""short interest"" has been thrown around a lot in recent times. Wanted to contribute by giving creating a [Webapp](http://short-o-meter.herokuapp.com/) that provides more transparency to the short interest of any given stock listed in the US markets.

Daily short volume % can be used as a gauge as to the level of shorting that is being done on a stock on any single day. Websites such as [shortvolumes.com](https://shortvolumes.com/) or [stickgrid.io](https://stickgrid.io/) provide short volume % that do not tell the full picture of what is going on. For instance, [shortvolumes.com](https://shortvolumes.com/) do not account for NYSE data, while [stockgrid.io](https://stockgrid.io/) ONLY accounts for FINRA data when providing that short volume figures.

This web app aims to improve transparency within this area. It automates the process of retrieving daily short volume reports from the various US Equity Markets (e.g. NYSE, NASDAQ, CBOE/BATS, and trades reported to FINRA TRFs), and breakdowns all the data clearly for you to see.

Note: **The figures here should account for** [**\~75% of daily trading volume on average**](https://www.cboe.com/us/equities/market_share/market/) **for non-Nasdaq heavy stocks. Data will be automatically updated when the exchanges upload their short sale volume data into their respective FTP/Databases. For guidance, FINRA &amp; Nasdaq updates their data no later than 6:00:00pm ET, while the rest of the exchanges will typically do so no later than 9:00:00pm ET of the same day on the relevant trade date. Nasdaq (Q) data, which usually accounts for** [**\~20% of total market volume for all U.S. Equities**](https://www.cboe.com/us/equities/market_share/market/)**, is not included here as it requires a** [**distributor fee**](http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=DPUSdata#shortsale)**. Only data prior to August 1, 2010 for Nasdaq (Q) is available. Remaining exchanges \[MEMX (U), IEX (V), MIAX (H) &amp; LTSE (L)\] which usually accounts for** [**\~5% of total market volume for all U.S. Equities**](https://www.cboe.com/us/equities/market_share/market/) **are not included here similarly as I am not able to find their data through open-source channels.**

PART I - Disruptor/Innovator

Clover Health collects and analyzes health &amp; behavioral data to lower costs and improve medical outcomes for its customers through the Clover Assistant. The Clover Assistant Program was created to share Clover Health’s data platform with healthcare providers to help them provide great, personalized care to their patients. This data includes lab results, prescriptions lists, and previous diagnoses, including those from other clinicians. Personalized care plans are made simple by receiving and sharing new information at each Clover Health patient visit and having access to clinical decision support.

PART II - Investors in Clover Health

Shares Outstanding - 376.17M
Shares Float - 112.10M
Insider Ownership - 24.40% (When Insiders own shares they more likely than not have a personal interest of the growth and success of the company)
106.19% of Shares Held by Institutions
140.47% of Float Held by Institutions

Alphabet Inc.(Google) and Sequoia are also early investors in Clover Health.

Part III - Financials

Clover Health  currently has no debt and 700M cash on hand. In 2020, Clover Health reported total revenue of $673 million, a 45.6% increase compared to $462.3 million in 2019. In Q1 2021, Clover Health reported 200M in revenue vs Q1 2020 $165.5 million in revenue, an increase of 21% primarily due to an increase in membership. For the full year, Clover Health expects to grow its Medicare Advantage patient count by 19.5% YoY to 69,000. The company also expects to have 200,000 Medicare beneficiaries through its new direct contracting programs, compared to zero in the prior year. Clover Health 2021 revenue projections range from $810 to $830 million. It estimates its operating income less non-cash expenses (EBITDA) will be ($215) million, but that will be covered with the company’s existing liquidity. Clover Health is forecasted to be profitable over the next 3 years. 


TECHNICAL ANALYSIS -

The stock price has collapsed after its strong run to $28, and is currently in a downtrend. It has held the $9 support level for 2 consecutive days, which can be seen as a positive. The next levels of resistance are $10, $12, and then $15. 
Volume has been below average in the recent trading sessions.


CATALYSTS &amp; GROWTH -

1. Clover Health’s recent partnership with Walmart. 
2. CMS approving the expansion to 101 more counties (that’s almost double their current footprint).
3. Medicare expansion (qualifying age dropping from 65 to 60 years old).
4. DOJ case settling


Short Squeeze Potential -

With a Short Float of 36.93%, CLOV is ranked #5 on the most shorted stocks list via MarketWatch. The low stock supply (376.17M shares outstanding) &amp; low float (112.10M shares) makes CLOV a potential short squeeze target. The fact that 140.47% of the float is held by institutions makes this a very interesting play indeed. Days to Cover via MarketBeat is 0.8


Gamma Squeeze Potential -

CLOV contracts expiring July 16,2021, with the Strike Prices of $10, $11, $12, $13, $14, $15, and $20 have a large amount of Open Interest (all exceeding 10k). CLOV contracts expiring August 20, 2021, with the Strike Prices of $9, $10, $12.50, $15, $20, and $30 also have a large amount of Open Interest (all exceeding 10k). These strike prices are also the critical price levels, that IMO, can trigger a shift in momentum and can trigger a gamma squeeze.

The company also expects to have 200,000 Medicare beneficiaries through its new direct contracting programs, compared to zero in the prior year. Clover Health 2021 revenue projections range from $810 to $830 million. It estimates its operating income less non-cash expenses (EBITDA) will be ($215) million, but that will be covered with the company’s existing liquidity. Clover Health is forecasted to be profitable over the next 3 years. 


TECHNICAL ANALYSIS -

The stock price has collapsed after its strong run to $28, and is currently in a downtrend. It has held the $9 support level for 2 consecutive days, which can be seen as a positive. The next levels of resistance are $10, $12, and then $15. 
Volume has been below average in the recent trading sessions.


CATALYSTS &amp; GROWTH -

1. Clover Health’s recent partnership with Walmart. 
2. CMS approving the expansion to 101 more counties (that’s almost double their current footprint).
3. Medicare expansion (qualifying age dropping from 65 to 60 years old).
4. DOJ case settling


Short Squeeze Potential -

With a Short Float of 36.93%, CLOV is ranked #5 on the most shorted stocks list via MarketWatch. The low stock supply (376.17M shares outstanding) &amp; low float (112.10M shares) makes CLOV a potential short squeeze target. The fact that 140.47% of the float is held by institutions makes this a very interesting play indeed. Days to Cover via MarketBeat is 0.8


Gamma Squeeze Potential -

CLOV contracts expiring July 16,2021, with the Strike Prices of $10, $11, $12, $13, $14, $15, and $20 have a large amount of Open Interest (all exceeding 10k). CLOV contracts expiring August 20, 2021, with the Strike Prices of $9, $10, $12.50, $15, $20, and $30 also have a large amount of Open Interest (all exceeding 10k). These strike prices are also the critical price levels, that IMO, can trigger a shift in momentum and can trigger a gamma squeeze.

Ortex reported a net decrease in borrowed shares of about 29M, which caused some concern that the shorts may be covering more than we thought without seeing the corresponding price action we were expecting.

However, Ortex tracks borrowed shares that are returned. Not necessarily borrowed shares that were sold short, bought back, and then returned.

Ihor Dusabiwsky with S3 Parnters has his own proprietary tracking system, and they do track actual shorted shares returned. According to their data, there was a net return of 1.4M shorted shares this week (1.6% of the total 88.2M shares currently sold short).

This means that hedge funds only actually covered 1.4M short shares this week, and decided to return another 27.6M shares that they had borrowed but not yet sold short (likely because they finally realized what a terrible idea it is to short AMC).

So let’s do some math. Short sellers covered 1.6% of their short position this week, and the share price went up 83%. If you assume the same rate of price increase for each percentage point of short interest covered going forward, then shorts fully covering their position would correspond to a percentage increase of 5,188% over today’s $47.91 closing price. That equals $2,485.60 per share.

And perhaps most importantly, these calculations only account for the covering of LEGAL shorts that are publicly reported to outlets such as Ortex and S3. There are many theories out there on how many illegal/naked/synthetic shares there may be, but the general consensus (backed by some extremely solid DD) is that there are a significant amount, many times more than the number of legal shorts.

You do the math. This thing is far from over.

it made me look hard enough that I jumped in last year. Ended up selling close to the 2021 top. After this rise the stock was shorted and company didn’t gain as much publicity even though it received its first FDA approval for Twirla. 

The stock has been beaten down with significant insider buying:


“As you can see on the above chart, since the middle of February, the price of AGRX stock has declined from around $3.60 to current levels touching $2.

However, three insiders have decided to take advantage of this weakness by making significant personal investments and engaging in insider buying. According to forms filed with the SEC, between Mar. 23 and Mar. 29, they acquired a total of 72,500 shares. They each paid around $2 a share.

According to Tipranks, four analysts following Agile believe it is undervalued as well. The consensus rating is a strong buy. The average target price is $8.25. That is four times higher than where shares are currently trading.”

What does this mean? It means your girlfriend has a new option to avoid getting knocked up by her other boyfriend. 

It also means there’s a huge market to tap into and a huge buy out possibly on the horizon for this company. Imagine a multibilly acquisition by the likes of a J&amp;J and their ability to commercialize and distribute this product.

Peramivir (Rapivab) is a ***Government-bio defense antiviral drug*** for the treatment of ***Influenza***.  Peramivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor, acting as a transition-state  analogue inhibitor of influenza neuraminidase and thereby preventing new  viruses from emerging from infected cells.

In 2009 the department of Health and Human Services had already given about ***$180 million*** to support the program.

In 2013 (BARDA/HHS) released new funding under the current ***$234.8 million*** contract to enable completion of a New Drug Application filing for intravenous (IV) peramivir.

Galidesivir (BCX4430) is a  broad-spectrum antiviral in advanced development for the treatment of  viruses that pose a threat to health and national security, including  SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19), Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and  Zika. Galidesivir has also demonstrated broad-spectrum activity in vitro  against more than 20 ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses in nine different  families, including coronaviruses, filoviruses, togaviruses,  bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses and flaviviruses.   (Hepatitis C, West Nile, Dengue, Jap Encephalitis, Yellow Fever, TBEV,  OHFV, and Zika), orthomyxoviruses and picornaviruses... Galidesivir  trials are *fully funded by the NIAID*, It's a ***Government funded*** ***bio-defense drug.***

Galidesivir was safe and well tolerated in ***Phase 1*** clinical safety and pharmacokinetics trials by both intravenous and intramuscular routes of administration in healthy subjects.

 

FOP is an ultra-rare, severely  disabling condition characterized by the irregular formation of bone  outside the normal skeleton, also known as heterotopic ossification  (HO). HO can occur in muscles, tendons and soft tissue. Patients with  FOP become bound by this irregular ossification over time, with  restricted movement and fused joints, resulting in deformities and  premature mortality. There are currently ***no approved treatments for FOP.***

There are an estimated ***3,500 to 9,000 patients*** worldwide, with ***900 diagnosed*** so far.

Market size for this treatment is estimated to reach ***500M-900M*** in 2025, growing to 3B in 2028 as more patients are diagnosed. With a price ranging from $900K-$1M/year.

***“In  PH1 study, BCX9250 demonstrated potency for the target kinase,  selectivity, safety and strong suppression of HO in animal models, safe  and well tolerated”***

 

BCX9930 is a novel, ***oral, potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of Factor D***  which recently completed Phase 1 clinical development for the treatment  of complement-mediated diseases. Treatment that is able to ***control*** *both* ***Intravascular and Extravascular hemolysis.***

FDA granted ***Fast Track / Orphan drug designation*** for BCX9930's PNH study.

BCX9930  is an oral inhibitor of the Factor D enzyme that activates Factor B to  form the C3 alternative pathway. Developing this kind of inhibitors  ain't easy at all. Most of this inhibitors in the development process  fail or obtain poor results. At the moment BCX9930 is the ***best-in-class*** inhibitor in the game. Reasons will be explained below.

3. **CEO has commented on being able to ""handily"" beat earnings next quarter**

Last quarter they were expected to only get 0.26 EPS they crushed that expectation by getting 0.36 EPS this is due to their newest drug being approved and marketed the ceo seems to think next quarter will be even bigger than the last.

It is very important to note here the only other treatment for HAE is injection based only. This makes it very likely the person with said disease will switch to this oral pill over an injection for improved life quality netting more revenue for the company.

If you really want to put the hurt on the MMs and HFs you gotta protect yourself. If you think GME is a meme stock gtfo of this post.

The big boys have an insane amount of short interest and an insane amount of capital and will bend the SP whatever way they want since it's a small cap. Literally half a 1MM of buying will light this thing up $2 a share. If you're retail you need to protect yourself.

(Btw the reason they can't bend it back to $4 is because they're running out of shares to short)

 If the stock price goes down to where it was before September they all cover no problem WSB loses no squeeze boo hoo your wife's boyfriend moves in for a month. So it begs the question, how do I keep my tendies when the big boys keep selling? Retail paper hands are gonna fuck on this SP every time there's 300k shares sold short every open.

If you look at the charts, occasionally there are days where the shorts buy back en masse. A huge volume spike with a correlating SP upswing of 15+%. On these days lots of people sell off and shares free up. Now how do you add more pain....

If you've been paying attention the squeeze can only happen if enough SHARES are locked up. You can thank Burry and the HF Boyz for the tiny float available, but the retail player needs to tie up SHARES. 

""But I need my tendies, when I see 15+% green I sell!""

Good point, buy low sell high. But maybe you can do better.

The amount of downward force coming from the hedgies shorting is unreal. They will always depress the price to reduce their borrowing fees and eventually buy back the shares. This is a blessing.

 And here's why:

*You can buy OTM puts on days that see 15%+ gains*

By insuring your shares stay valuable after the spike, you pay a premium up front to be *protected* when the big Boyz start shorting again. With the put in place it doesn't matter that the stock is shorted to oblivion because you have locked in your gainz. 

""But what if they don't short more?"" 

Good question retard. The answer is they will pay interest on a higher stock principle. High stock = more bleed.

If you have puts that are 2 weeks out EXP you can wait for the SP to get manhandled back to $10 and exercise. Lock in the gainz from the put and reset your position at a lower cost basis. Now you got your tendies and you still have the same amount of shares. Rinse and repeat until BofA lets you fuck their wife.

This can literally go tits up IF GME goes bankrupt. Now if you can read any kind of financial statement and have any faith in Cohen Burry etc you'll realize it's tough for most businesses with $4 cash/share to hit Ch. 11. But as long as they have shares on the market, this might work.

This is purely a thought experiment and I am not a financial advisor. Do whatever you want with your life man.

# Overview

With a lot of chatter online and a lot of interest in the stock I thought it might be worthwhile to talk about how I am trading $UWMC this week. I’m a terrible investor but it occurred to me some of you may be worse. 

# Think Long Term

**If no squeeze happens this week, will you still feel good about your investment decisions?** 

Being aware of short term price action and asynchronous upside is a fine thing. But short squeezes are rare and same week investment tendies are not sustainable. Whatever investment decision you make this week make sure you are okay with yourself Saturday morning if the squeeze investment thesis doesn’t play out. If the squeeze was a sure thing, it would have already happened. 

**But OP, you got a bunch of calls this week, are you thinking long term?** 

Honestly, my call position got oversized as I averaged down. I’ve already taken a bit of profits and plan to take a bit more depending on the price action. I also but the 6c’s with the intent to exercise so they were a leveraged play with a long term horizon. The 9c’s I entered recently and are pure speculation/gambling. If they expire worthless I’ll live. 

**Should I buy options or shares?** 

If you have to ask that question, definitely not options. Spend some time learning what they do and how they behave. Buying shares are always the preferred and safer route to take. Shares have no expiry and the closer you buy an option to expiry the less you are investing and the more you are gambling. Always think long term with your investment money. If you have some gambling money, sure! Options have always seemed more for to gamble on than a basketball game. I prefer shares over LEAPS for UWMC because of the outsized dividends. 

**Okay dad but… is there squeeze potential this week?** 

**How likely is a short squeeze?** 

I’m trading assuming a short squeeze won’t happen. UWMC has 13% short interest which doesn’t seem to me to be enough to push shorts to cover this week. 

An important point here is the available float for UWMC is… small. This is covered in other DD’s more in depth. This always means that outsized market moves are a potential. Retail traders aren’t selling this week with gamma squeeze hopes as well as many institutional investors are underwater with $10+ price averages. 

**But isn’t there some weird short squeeze action?** 

This is where things start to get… interesting. The borrow rate is currently 97%. This means it is crazy expensive to short this stock, probably due to shorts not being able to find enough shares to short. [source](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/UWMC)

There has also been some weird “Failure to Deliver” action. I’m not smart enough for this but basically UWMC has action on it where people are supposed to receive shares and don’t. I’ll let this post dive deeper on that: [SEC failure to deliver 24 days and counting](https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMCShareholders/comments/nfazzm/sec_fails_to_deliver_uwmc_24days_and_counting/). 

**But isn’t the gamma squeeze where the action is?** 

The most exciting scenario is a gamma squeeze. UWMC doesn’t have weeklies so the monthly options can pile up. I’m not smart enough for delta hedging, etc. but I can read Open Interest fine enough. Especially with the recent retail interest, open interest for this week is exploding. [source](https://twitter.com/UPBOptionMil/status/1394376112621375489?s=20) &amp; [source](https://twitter.com/OptionsProVol/status/1394677108924813312?s=20)

There are 167,800 options OTM at 9, 10, &amp; 12.5 strikes. As the price rises market makers will be forced to purchase shares to remain delta neutral. Part of the elevated volume Monday may have been market makers needing to cover their 7.5c’s (with 23,885 of Open Interest). 

**So with short interest at 13% of float, OTM option order open interest at 15% of float @ May 21 expiry, $300 million share buyback underway (total float is \~$850 million), institutional investors own 25% of float and retail owns x% of float…**

# Short interest

**Mrin short interest is estimated to be 189 % from ortex**. **18.68 million shares shorted** of which only 9.65 million shares exist in float. This is GME level short interest with an even SMALLER float.

You may be thinking well since mrin already had its run then most of the shorts are on the top right?

**Yes that is true majority of this SI is around 5 to 18 dollars.**

But look at the stock price now. Its trending above 20. A whale is pumping the stock to squeeze these shorts.

&amp;#x200B;

**How many shorts have covered so far?**

At the day of this DD only a mere 204k shorts have covered and infact an additional 108k shorts have been added

**Cost to borrow is 172% and they have maxed out short utilization.**

Short utilization is the amount of shorts borrowed from the total available shorts they can lend from institutions.

A 100 percent means at any point an institution can recall back their shares and shorts have to cover.

Cost to borrow being an insane number of 172% means it costs a fortune to hold these shares each day they are in the red.

# So whats happening now?

Its very likely that **multiple hedgefunds are pumping the stock to squeeze the shorts themselves**. I barely see any retail talking about this yet every mainstream news is attributing it to reddit. Yet you look left and right of reddit and you barely see anyone talking about this.

So we don't have an insane retail hype like GME yet we are trading GME JAN volumes. Th**is is entirely big moby dicks trying to squeeze.**

# Downside risk

**Listen this is a lottery ticket stock.** This thing has the potential to go to the 40s or higher. If we had options this thing would skyrocket beyond gme.

However its risky territory because we don't know how fast shorts can cover with high frequency trades or if the whale that is pumping the stock decides to let go.

Right now everything seems to fall in line though.

Do not tell anyone on this thread to buy, sell, or hold.

Do not ask anyone if you should buy, sell, or hold.

If you do you may be getting unwanted attention from the SEC for trying to manipulate the price of a stock. We are not here to try to manipulate the price of GME, we are here to try to determine if there is still a possibility that another squeeze is coming and what the facts are surrounding that possibility. The SEC may be out for blood on this one so don't give them anything that they can say. Esp on a thread that I started. Read the following in full:

### 7. Will close-out purchases required by Regulation SHO drive up a security’s price?

Close-out purchases of stock will not necessarily drive up prices of such stocks. One of the primary purposes of Regulation SHO is to clean up open fail positions, but not to cause short squeezes. The term “short squeeze” refers to the pressure on short sellers to cover their positions as a result of sharp price increases or difficulty in borrowing the security the sellers are short. The rush by short sellers to cover produces additional upward pressure on the price of the stock, which then can cause an even greater squeeze. ***Although some short squeezes may occur naturally in the market, a scheme to manipulate the price or availability of stock in order to cause a short squeeze is illegal.***

Any false information I have stated in any and all posts on this subject were mistakes due to the fact that I am a total amateur at trading stocks. I'm doing the best I can as are most of the people here. We are learning all of this on the fly.  So guys and gals, please word your posts carefully. 

Update #2 coming later today (Monday, Feb 15th)

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------

\[UPDATE #1: Wow! You guys are awesome! So much great information. Thanks for posting links to where you got info from, it saves us all a lot of time. I've got tons of stuff to research now and lots of good leads to follow thanks to you guys.

As of right now, we have clarified a number of facts about the current situation. We have also discovered a few new mysteries to unravel. There appear to be several unrelated stocks that showed the exact same spike as GME at the exact same time. We expected the ETF's to do that, but these are not ETF's with GME in them. They seem to have nothing to do with GME at all!

In addition, we have a debate going on over a few key points:

1. Can Hedgefunds act as AP's for ETF's? I don't know. I know banks can.
2. Can an ETF get short squoze? We know they can just issue more shares and liquidate, but is there any way it could happen? Also, on this point it isn't the fund itself or it's AP's that have to deliver. It's whoever is late on delivering the shorts to their customer. Meaning in many cases a hedgefund. So issuing more shares might dilute the price as a squeeze is happening, but why would the ETF give a shit? They didn't short the stock, some hedgefund did.
3. Some are saying that the shorts being covered could have been faked. This is a very interesting idea. Shorting the ETF's and then gong long on the rest of the equities in the fund to nullify the effect of the short on those while keeping the effect of the target stock being shorted. How could this satisfy the fail to delivers for the target stock? I don't totally understand this theory yet but it's late and I have to sleep. I'll post another update tomorrow.

Lastly, READ THIS IF NOTHING ELSE:

THIS IS JUST A THEORY AT THIS POINT

SOME STUFF I SAY MAY OR WILL BE SLIGHTLY WRONG UNTIL THE DETAILS ARE FIGURED OUT

DO NOT MAKE A MOVE IN THE MARKET YET BASED ON THIS THEORY (I'd feel bad if you lost money before we had a solid thing figured out completely)

BE NICE TO EACH OTHER- WE ARE ALL JUST TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT TOGETHER

\--------------------------------

Original Post:

I'm gonna make this quick. If you don't know what I""m talking about please research it and then reread this post.

Okay, we know GME came off the Threshold list on Feb 3rd. That means they covered almost all of their FTD's (fail to deliver). Many of these they bought from us on the open market at high prices, however many people have speculated that it doesn't seem to be enough. We know they stopped many of us from buying and that appears that it may have been collusion to make sure there were enough shares available so that Melvin and friends could buy them to deliver to those they already sold shares they didn't have to. But was that even enough? They were on the threshold list for 39 days straight and they covered it all in just a few days? Maybe. But what if it wasn't enough? Where did they get the rest of the shares they needed? Remember, if they don't deliver in 13 days after the 3 day settlement period is up, then they lose the right to short sell forever. That is why they had to buy at the higher prices and that is the main reason, along with the hype, that the stock price spiked.

Now, we are all hoping that there will be another spike, which would only be true if the short sellers were back in the same situation they were before. Many of us speculate that somehow they found a way to just kick the can down the road, meaning they put off the squeeze to a future date. But the DD on this is lacking.

Also, we have noticed that the price chart for AMC looks identical to the chart for GME, other than the price. No ne can figure out why other than to speculate that it;s just because many people who buy/sell GME are also buying and selling AMC at the same time. This may or may not be true or may be partially true. We don't know for sure.

Now, if they did kick the can down the road somehow, then where did they get the shares to cover? Enter ETF's. There are several ETF's that have GME as part of their portfolio. I have only looked at one. I need you guys to check out the other ones because I am short on time. I checked out a fund whose ticker is XRT. Their chart looks exactly like the GME and AMC chart! And GME is one of their main stocks that make up part of their fund. Coincidence?

Now, there is a thing called an AP which means an Authorized Participant.

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/authorizedparticipant.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/authorizedparticipant.asp)

A ETF's AP is allowed to buy the underlying stocks that make up the ETF and then create new shares of  that ETF, but they are also allowed to  take existing shares of the ETF and liquidate them back into their   original stocks. Read this:

[https://jacobslevycenter.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ETF-Short-Interest-and-Failures-to-Deliver.pdf](https://jacobslevycenter.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ETF-Short-Interest-and-Failures-to-Deliver.pdf)

Now, XRT went ON the threshold list on January \[edit: 29th\] and has remained there to this very day! That is the same day that the hedgefunds supposedly covered most of their short positions and the GME spike started to drop as well as about the same time the brokers stopped letting us buy!

We need to know what happened to the XRT outstanding shares between five days before the 26/27 of January and up to today. We also need to know if the short volume increased during that time and any other relevant information that might show whether or not the Hedgefunds used the ETF's to get the shares they needed to cover their FTD's. If so, they borrowed them from the FTD's, which explains why XRT is now on the threshold list right about when GME came off of it. For context there are thousands of stocks, yet only about 20 are ever on the threshold list at any given day. What are the odds, considering the relationship between XRT and GME, that one would go ON the list right bou tthe same time the other came OFF the list?

My theory is that the HF's used the ETF's that had shares of GME to cover their failed short positions so that GME would come off the threshold list. This would make us all think that the opportunity is over, however the ETF's involved are now in the exact same position that GME was in just before the spike. They just moved the crisis from one place to another.

Please post any and only legit research on this and provide links. I will do the same as I continue to research this issue. Thanks.

Also, I am not a professional when it comes to stocks. I am a rank amateur who is just trying to figure this all out. I am not advocating any action on the part of anyone else when it comes to buying, selling, or holding stocks. You are responsible for your own actions in the stock market.

Firstly, I want to thank everyone who commented constructively yesterday on [my initial AMC DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljz99b/amc_blockbuster_dd/). A lot of good input and questions. I thought it'd be best to try and summarize/address a lot of the concerns raised in a second DD, where I can get more into the details, in advance of the market opening tomorrow.

This sequel DD is split in Fundamentals and Mementals. A tl;dr is at the top of each section. At the bottom you'll find my thoughts on catalysts and forward momentum drivers. You don't have to agree, that's just how I see things. I'm not trying to convince anyone. My position is 15,000 shares at about $2.40 price. For those who wonder why I didn't sell at the squeeze: I bought the shares before the stock started mooning and had sold covered calls. It was too expensive to get out of them, so I was rolling them up. Unfortunately for me, the squeeze subsided before I could extract myself from the calls, so I'm still in, and at a substantial unrealized profit as well. **My horizon is up to the end of 2021 the latest, so I'm only assessing the potential for the share price to go up until then** \- I'm not in it for years. I'll probably sell some CSPs in the meantime and if it stabilizes higher by June or earlier I'll sell some CCs for income.

I'll preface this DD by saying that in 2020, and it looks like in 2021 as well, fundamentals don't mean much one way or another in my opinion. It's pure moment trading in the market from what I gather and everything is overvalued. Every-fucking-thing is overvalued, so saying that a company's fundamentals aren't that great means shit when you got stocks with $bn market caps which have never turned a profit, have no product and won't sell anything for years to come. Investors are looking for what's least overvalued, or what may benefit from momentum over the next few weeks/months and jump on it as soon as possible. Today 2/15 the markets were closed in N.America, but Europe was open and anything related to post-Covid normalcy skyrocketed. All leisure/travel stocks mooned even though noone is travelling yet. I do really expect something like this will be happening in the american stock market very soon, if not immediately, as well. People will try to position themselves for the post-covid times as sentiment shifts to positive. I expect big rotations out of tech stocks and likewise into leisure/travel/socializing and back-to-business stocks. I do think AMC is one of the beneficiaries, irrespective of fundamentals or not.

Finally, all my figures are taken from the company's own annual report unless stated otherwise.

&amp;#x200B;

# Fundamentals:

**tl;dr = if AMC does not change strategy it will stagnate and it's share price will not move much. I think $5 is the bottom anyways so getting in at this price point is fairly low risk. Should the price drop more after buying in you can make up the difference with CCs over a few months. Should it stay where it's at, again, selling CCs is a nice way to make money. But don't sell CCs just yet, because when it rallies you'll be trapped. Wait until it's price stabilizes.**

Onto the details:

Let's get something out of the way really quickly. AMC reaching meme status did not do anything for its solvency. Nothing, nada, 0. AMC had managed to raised capital through debt and equity BEFORE it became a meme, so shut up with that bullshit and google the timelines. Their CEO had announced that bankruptcy is off the table way before the stock took off.

&amp;#x200B;

Some share prices for your pleasure and education:

*Processing img 1x6u00gl0qh61...*

**Highlights:**

Mar 2015: **$35** @ 97.5m shares outsatnding by year end

Jan 2015: **$22** @ 97.5m shares outsatnding by year end

Dec 2016: **$35** @ 128m shares oustanding by year end

March 2017: **$31.5** @ 128m shares oustanding by year end

Aug 2017: **$13** @ 128m shares oustanding by year end (20.3m shares issued in Feb at @ $31.5)

Sept 2018: **$21** @ 104m shares outstanding by year end (retired 24m shares in Sept @ $17.5)

July 2019: **$9.5** @ 104m shares outstanding by year end

&amp;#x200B;

The above is some food for thought for those who say that AMC has diluted itself so much the price will stay forever low. As you see, the AMC share price has fluctuated wildly despite being diluted in the past, and despite revenues and profits not growing much. Therefore anyone who says this will go to $1 because of debt or dilution is talking out of their ass and is too ashamed to say they are a bear. The price has gone up and down despite being diluted and borrowing increasing, and it will go up and down again. The question is what will drive it either way.

&amp;#x200B;

Shares dilution from 2020 onwards:

* Feb 21st 2020: 52.5m Class A and 51.7m Class B
* Jan 2021: 287m Class A and 51.8m Class B
* Jan 2021: 44.4m shares added due to convertible bonds sold as shares
* 2/15/21 estimated shares outstanding are: 287m+51.8m+44.4m = 383.2m (my estimate, could be wrong)

Note: there is a difference between shares outstanding and float. Float is what is available to buy in the market, which is of interest when you start thinking about short interest.

&amp;#x200B;

According to the following sites:

* [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMC)
* [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc)
* [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/key-statistics/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/key-statistics/)
* [https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMC?mod=searchresults\_companyquotes](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMC?mod=searchresults_companyquotes)
* [https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/amc-stock](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/amc-stock)

Float is between 56.1m to 115m depending on where you look.

Btw, they all quote shares outstanding as 287m, so maybe I'm double counting something?

&amp;#x200B;

Short interest:

According to these sites the short interest ranges from:

* [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/short-interest/)
* [https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AMC.htm](https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AMC.htm)
* [https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest](https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest)
* [https://docoh.com/news/benzinga/19561873/top-30-high-short-interest](https://docoh.com/news/benzinga/19561873/top-30-high-short-interest)

37.7m shares and some quote 79% of float. Clearly a lot of sites are calculating float as 56.1m.

If anyone has any official sources on short interest it'd be great to see. In any case, I'm not advocating that this will be short squeezed. That has nothing to do with my thesis. On 2/25 the Q4 ER is taking place so we'll have a definitive answer on shares outstanding.

**Tickets, sales, customers:**

2019 = 356m consumers

2019 = NYC, LA and Chicago represent 17% of USA total box office. AMC holds 39% market share there.

&amp;#x200B;

[2019 annual report](https://preview.redd.it/mxpbc9wp0qh61.png?width=1664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bcac6e37fa3fa23c30d671ac3a42c8ddb859237)

It appears that there are y.o.y fluctuations on attendance. Adjusting the 2010 box office revenue for inflation ([https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/)) would result in 2019 sales of $12.5bn, when real sales were $11.4bn. Therefore, when adjusted for inflation the box office sales are not keeping up. However, it's worth noting that neither the ticket price nor the indoor screens have increased by inflation, and looking at the figures AMC is making more money per screen. I believe the reason why box office sales haven't kept up to inflation is because the strategy for theatres has been stale. I also want to believe that COVID has been a wake up call for the theatre industry to diversity and execute on more bold strategies, which combined with cost cutting measures should pay off going forward.

**Competition:**

2019 annual report = the 3 largest exhibitors are AMC, Regal (now bought out and turned private) and Cinemark, which account for 60% of box office revenues. Back in 2000 they accounted for 35% of revenues, so there is substantial consolidation happening.

Non-theatrical competition is of course the streaming services, cable tv, pay-per-view etc. In reality it's only streaming services as pay-per-view and cable tv is dead as a dodo.

Current (2021) peers are IMAX, Regal and Cinemark.

**Ops:**

2019 annual report: 1,004 theatres (636 in US) and 11,041 screens (8,094 in US). The rest are in Europe and Saudi Arabia. Market leader in USA and Europe.

26% of their revenue comes from int'l market. Europe is reopening fast and the UK GBP (biggest int'l market for AMC) is increasing in value, which in combo with a weak US dollar will bolster revenue figures.

A lot of people commented on AMC not making money and that it's doomed etc. Looking at their financials:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4am3oenr0qh61.png?width=1236&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d128de7c97c295f2552e4ca95d068c43f42ed8e

It seems to me that the biggest bummers with regard to their operating income have been rent and Opex. Rent expenses went up purely due to accounting standards, but the end result is that it made their EBITDA look worse. Should accounting treatment rules had not changed their 2019 EBITDA would have been very close to 2018.

*Note: in one of my responses to a comment in my previous DD I erroneously suggested (that's what I thought) that the capex servicing and SG&amp;A were what was dragging them down, but that seems to remain stable year on year - which are of course dragging them down, but are not what causes fluctuations in their yearly profitability.*

Now, we know that AMC has done a lot of work to keep rent costs down, and has done massive strides to reduce OPEX. Hence why I strongly think the profitability margins will improve going forward, all else remaining equal. Just look at the int'l markets where OPEX was the reverse (4.3% down y.o.y) and how it made all the difference in their bottom line. Add to that the fact they have gotten rid of a lot of underperforming screens. OPEX should go further down as everyone gets vaccinated and any additional spending on COVID sanitizing is no longer necessary.

**Capex:**

Between 2015-2019 AMC has built 37 new theatres with 310 new screens and bought out 700 theatres and 6,500 screens. They have doubled their capacity in 5 years. That's a lot of CAPEX spending, and obviously a lot of borrowing to deliver that.

Capital spending was $0.5bn in 2019, $0.6bn in 2018 and $0.6bn in 2017. This is resulting to about $300m cash outflows to serve that capex, per year from 2020 and onwards.

It appears that capital spending has stopped, so at least no more new servicing costs.

**Debt:**

2019 = $4.8bn

2020 (9/30): $5.82bn, but we know that in 2021 about $600m was converted to shares, so debt should be about $5.2bn currently. Again, if I've missed any bonds let me know.

**Comparables:**

Price to Book (ttm) and 5yr avrg:

AMC -0.26 / 1.16

MSGE 0.85 / 0.63

CNK 2.41 / 3.12

IMAX 3.34 / 3.54

AMC has the lowest valued share price amongst its competitors, therefore appears the cheapest across the peers. It also trades far lower compares to its 5yr average compared to its peers. Should the tide change it should see its price equalize to the others then there is a great upside. You may say that AMC has a lot of debt etc., well the rest are not in a much better position, with CNK being screwed with Regal for instance.

&amp;#x200B;

# Mementals:

**tl;dr: A lot of positive catalysts await, and every single piece of news will boost the price. Aside a resurge of COVID there is nothing stopping people returning to the theatres, and a slew of blockbusters will be coming out soon to entice them. A change of strategy should also help add some growth to the revenue which will only boost prices further.**

If we were to ignore fundamentals, like the rest of the market does, then we need to look at AMCs potential for popping, squeezing or rallying. I'll start by saying I don't think a short squeeze is in the books. I just doubt it. There's a lot of confusion around its short interest and float. What I do know is that the float has increased a lot compared to early 2020, but it appears that short interest has increased as well. I don't think that shorts have covered to a large extent since mid-Jan and I can see - through checking the IBKR availability of shares to borrow - that shorts are hitting it every day. It's worth noting that its share price is now 100%+ higher than were it was when they were shorting it, so who knows, but I don't count on it.

What I'm thinking is catalysts that will push the price upwards. I do expect that people are just gagging to go back to the cinema. That's not going to change once things reopen. Things that I expect will make the price rally:

\- COVID vaccine roll-out proceeds well and movie studios decide to finally start releasing movies. That should happen once capacity restrictions are lifted at movie theatres. There will be a big marketing push around this in the news.

\- NYC and LA announcing the reopening of theatres at full capacity. This will happen and will happen soon. It will lift the price by a lot as those two are the price revenue makers for AMC.

\- Partnership with a major streaming service. Netflix, Amazon or Disney, or even bought up by a major movie studio. The synergies are insane and the worst case scenario for those giants' balance sheets is negligible. Streaming service subscription numbers are stagnating and streaming giants are forced to increase prices (hi Netflix) to make up for growth. Expanding through an acquisition of AMC makes sense to reach out and grow further. It'll be like Amazon buying up Walmart. Low chance but even chatter about it will push the price up fast.

\- Summer (and Xmas) are the prime seasons where studios release movies. This summer should be huge in terms of releases and times well with the reopening of theatres. This is guaranteed.

\- Wanda converted their shares and is no longer the controlling shareholder. This allows substantial more maneouvering ability to the executive team to do things differently.

\- COVID restrictions lifted sooner than expected. This will allow AMC to use the cash pile it has squirreled for a tough 2021 in repaying debt faster, reducing interest expenses and improving its net income. Any announcement around retiring debt will push the price up.

\- More strategic changes towards PVOD, eSPORTS, booking theatres to people through apps etc. to utilize all the spare seating capacity. Even at peak revenue AMC is only using 17% of its seats, so it's got a lot of idle capacity it can make money off with 0 additional costs. AMC should pivot to additional offerings on top of movie releases to capture more footfall in its screens. I do believe that COVID was a wake up call that will push them to more innovative ways of generating revenue.

\- As people return to theatres they will realize a lot of locals have shut down. There will be consolidation due to natural causes. Fewer screens but the same number of movie-goers. That's a benefit for AMC.

\- With sentiment improving around the economy reopening a lot of these stocks that were hit hard by Covid will get extreme tailwinds that will make them rally. Look at what happened when the Pfizer vaccine was announced with the massive rotation out of tech stocks. I expect similar moves, sooner rather than later. Biden is doing a decent job with vaccine roll out.

I believe that $5 is the new bottom of the share and I think we will be seeing a lot of weekly pops with small pullbacks, basically higher highs and higher lows, going forward. If you actively manage your position you may be able to exit at the high points and reenter at the pullbacks for additional profit.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't see any negatives aside from COVID resurging for some reason. I do believe that the very worst is past for the theatre business.

&amp;#x200B;

**Finally, let me address some common comments:**

\- I got Netflix, why would I go to the movies?

You've had netflix for years, yet you (and everyone else) still goes to the movies. The movies are not gonna die anytime soon. Worst case they won't grow and stagnate, but they are here for years to come.

&amp;#x200B;

\- The studios will just offer their movies to streaming and not to theatres.

Absolute bullshit. Theatres are doing the opposite, pulling out catalogs from netflix. They are in a conundrum as they don't really know what to do. They don't want their movies streaming (because it's far, FAAAAAR less revenue for them) through 3rd parties but at the same time cannot create their own platforms to stream. The latter is just stupid. The CAPEX required to build your own platform is high, and the benefit is trivial since they can play movies in theatres and keep the majority of the ticket price. Besides, streaming movies only works for low budget films. Any blockbuster requires the cinematic experience. Very few people have top-model TVs at home with surround sound, and even if they do, 4K streamed over the internet results to sub-par quality. It just does not compare to the cinema quality. The only realistic alternative to cinema for home entertainment is having a top of the line tv+sound+bluray. But that's not streaming is it?

If streaming was to kill off theatres then VHS, DVD and Bluray would have done so before (Studios would have released straight to DVD, why didn't they?). It never happened and for good reason. People go to the movies because of a) The cinematic experience, b) they combine it with a night out, c) it's a way of socializing and much more. That won't go away. Btw, Disney, despite having a streaming platform decided to go ahead with theatrical releases of all its movies in 2021, and won't offer them on streaming at the same time. Get it now?

Another reason why that won't work = Look at Disney, they offered Mulan through their own platform, so what best example to examine. They did not offer it as part of the subscription, so forget about paying your monthly neftlix and having new movies for free. They instead priced it at about 2x movie tickets. Even if they are to continue that with their next releases it's not really that much more affordable compared to going to the movies, is it? So don't expect Universal or 20th Century offering you all their new movies for $10/month. Ain't gonna happen.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Theatres have been open since August but noone is going

Noone is going not only because of COVID concerns, but there are no movies to see. You need studios to release their movies for people to return. I don't expect them to do so until restrictions are lifted and everyone can safely return to the theatres.

&amp;#x200B;

\- So, what else besides James Bond is coming in 2021? why would I go to the cinema for just 1 movie.

You are an idiot. Here is a list of upcoming blockbuster releases: [https://qz.com/1948011/the-2021-movie-calendar-previews-hollywoods-new-normal/](https://qz.com/1948011/the-2021-movie-calendar-previews-hollywoods-new-normal/)

Look at summer time onwards, there is a hot movie almost every week. Most of the movies in the first half will likely be released in the second half after all, making it a bonanza of new films coming out in summer onwards.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Theatres are dead in the long term, aren't they?

We are all dead in the long term. I don't care. Let's focus in the next six months ok? My investment horizon for AMC is up to the end of 2021 the latest. In a best case scenario I expect the recovery to be fully priced in by summer time when I will exit or just start selling CCs again. I may exit/renter several times to what I think may be short-term peaks and troughs. I'm not Buffett so I'm not buying for life. I'm in this for the rally to normalcy.

Do not make any investment decisions based on the whatever I post online or say.**

Firstly, I want to thank everyone who commented constructively yesterday on [my initial AMC DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljz99b/amc_blockbuster_dd/). A lot of good input and questions. I thought it'd be best to try and summarize/address a lot of the concerns raised in a second DD, where I can get more into the details, in advance of the market opening tomorrow.

This sequel DD is split in Fundamentals and Mementals. A tl;dr is at the top of each section. At the bottom you'll find my thoughts on catalysts and forward momentum drivers. You don't have to agree, that's just how I see things. I'm not trying to convince anyone. My position is 15,000 shares at about $2.40 price. For those who wonder why I didn't sell at the squeeze: I bought the shares before the stock started mooning and had sold covered calls. It was too expensive to get out of them, so I was rolling them up. Unfortunately for me, the squeeze subsided before I could extract myself from the calls, so I'm still in, and at a substantial unrealized profit as well. **My horizon is up to the end of 2021 the latest, so I'm only assessing the potential for the share price to go up until then** \- I'm not in it for years. I'll probably sell some CSPs in the meantime and if it stabilizes higher by June or earlier I'll sell some CCs for income.

I'll preface this DD by saying that in 2020, and it looks like in 2021 as well, fundamentals don't mean much one way or another in my opinion. It's pure moment trading in the market from what I gather and everything is overvalued. Every-fucking-thing is overvalued, so saying that a company's fundamentals aren't that great means shit when you got stocks with $bn market caps which have never turned a profit, have no product and won't sell anything for years to come. Investors are looking for what's least overvalued, or what may benefit from momentum over the next few weeks/months and jump on it as soon as possible. Today 2/15 the markets were closed in N.America, but Europe was open and anything related to post-Covid normalcy skyrocketed. All leisure/travel stocks mooned even though noone is travelling yet. I do really expect something like this will be happening in the american stock market very soon, if not immediately, as well. People will try to position themselves for the post-covid times as sentiment shifts to positive. I expect big rotations out of tech stocks and likewise into leisure/travel/socializing and back-to-business stocks. I do think AMC is one of the beneficiaries, irrespective of fundamentals or not.

Finally, all my figures are taken from the company's own annual report unless stated otherwise.

&amp;#x200B;

# Fundamentals:

**tl;dr = if AMC does not change strategy it will stagnate and it's share price will not move much. I think $5 is the bottom anyways so getting in at this price point is fairly low risk. Should the price drop more after buying in you can make up the difference with CCs over a few months. Should it stay where it's at, again, selling CCs is a nice way to make money. But don't sell CCs just yet, because when it rallies you'll be trapped. Wait until it's price stabilizes.**

Onto the details:

Let's get something out of the way really quickly. AMC reaching meme status did not do anything for its solvency. Nothing, nada, 0. AMC had managed to raised capital through debt and equity BEFORE it became a meme, so shut up with that bullshit and google the timelines. Their CEO had announced that bankruptcy is off the table way before the stock took off.

&amp;#x200B;

Some share prices for your pleasure and education:

*Processing img 1x6u00gl0qh61...*

**Highlights:**

Mar 2015: **$35** @ 97.5m shares outsatnding by year end

Jan 2015: **$22** @ 97.5m shares outsatnding by year end

Dec 2016: **$35** @ 128m shares oustanding by year end

March 2017: **$31.5** @ 128m shares oustanding by year end

Aug 2017: **$13** @ 128m shares oustanding by year end (20.3m shares issued in Feb at @ $31.5)

Sept 2018: **$21** @ 104m shares outstanding by year end (retired 24m shares in Sept @ $17.5)

July 2019: **$9.5** @ 104m shares outstanding by year end

&amp;#x200B;

The above is some food for thought for those who say that AMC has diluted itself so much the price will stay forever low. As you see, the AMC share price has fluctuated wildly despite being diluted in the past, and despite revenues and profits not growing much. Therefore anyone who says this will go to $1 because of debt or dilution is talking out of their ass and is too ashamed to say they are a bear. The price has gone up and down despite being diluted and borrowing increasing, and it will go up and down again. The question is what will drive it either way.

&amp;#x200B;

Shares dilution from 2020 onwards:

* Feb 21st 2020: 52.5m Class A and 51.7m Class B
* Jan 2021: 287m Class A and 51.8m Class B
* Jan 2021: 44.4m shares added due to convertible bonds sold as shares
* 2/15/21 estimated shares outstanding are: 287m+51.8m+44.4m = 383.2m (my estimate, could be wrong)

Note: there is a difference between shares outstanding and float. Float is what is available to buy in the market, which is of interest when you start thinking about short interest.

&amp;#x200B;

According to the following sites:

* [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMC)
* [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc)
* [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/key-statistics/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/key-statistics/)
* [https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMC?mod=searchresults\_companyquotes](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMC?mod=searchresults_companyquotes)
* [https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/amc-stock](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/amc-stock)

Float is between 56.1m to 115m depending on where you look.

Btw, they all quote shares outstanding as 287m, so maybe I'm double counting something?

&amp;#x200B;

Short interest:

According to these sites the short interest ranges from:

* [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/short-interest/)
* [https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AMC.htm](https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AMC.htm)
* [https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest](https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest)
* [https://docoh.com/news/benzinga/19561873/top-30-high-short-interest](https://docoh.com/news/benzinga/19561873/top-30-high-short-interest)

37.7m shares and some quote 79% of float. Clearly a lot of sites are calculating float as 56.1m.

If anyone has any official sources on short interest it'd be great to see. In any case, I'm not advocating that this will be short squeezed. That has nothing to do with my thesis. On 2/25 the Q4 ER is taking place so we'll have a definitive answer on shares outstanding.

**Tickets, sales, customers:**

2019 = 356m consumers

2019 = NYC, LA and Chicago represent 17% of USA total box office. AMC holds 39% market share there.

&amp;#x200B;

[2019 annual report](https://preview.redd.it/mxpbc9wp0qh61.png?width=1664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bcac6e37fa3fa23c30d671ac3a42c8ddb859237)

It appears that there are y.o.y fluctuations on attendance. Adjusting the 2010 box office revenue for inflation ([https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/)) would result in 2019 sales of $12.5bn, when real sales were $11.4bn. Therefore, when adjusted for inflation the box office sales are not keeping up. However, it's worth noting that neither the ticket price nor the indoor screens have increased by inflation, and looking at the figures AMC is making more money per screen. I believe the reason why box office sales haven't kept up to inflation is because the strategy for theatres has been stale. I also want to believe that COVID has been a wake up call for the theatre industry to diversity and execute on more bold strategies, which combined with cost cutting measures should pay off going forward.

**Competition:**

2019 annual report = the 3 largest exhibitors are AMC, Regal (now bought out and turned private) and Cinemark, which account for 60% of box office revenues. Back in 2000 they accounted for 35% of revenues, so there is substantial consolidation happening.

Non-theatrical competition is of course the streaming services, cable tv, pay-per-view etc. In reality it's only streaming services as pay-per-view and cable tv is dead as a dodo.

Current (2021) peers are IMAX, Regal and Cinemark.

**Ops:**

2019 annual report: 1,004 theatres (636 in US) and 11,041 screens (8,094 in US). The rest are in Europe and Saudi Arabia. Market leader in USA and Europe.

26% of their revenue comes from int'l market. Europe is reopening fast and the UK GBP (biggest int'l market for AMC) is increasing in value, which in combo with a weak US dollar will bolster revenue figures.

A lot of people commented on AMC not making money and that it's doomed etc. Looking at their financials:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4am3oenr0qh61.png?width=1236&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d128de7c97c295f2552e4ca95d068c43f42ed8e

It seems to me that the biggest bummers with regard to their operating income have been rent and Opex. Rent expenses went up purely due to accounting standards, but the end result is that it made their EBITDA look worse. Should accounting treatment rules had not changed their 2019 EBITDA would have been very close to 2018.

*Note: in one of my responses to a comment in my previous DD I erroneously suggested (that's what I thought) that the capex servicing and SG&amp;A were what was dragging them down, but that seems to remain stable year on year - which are of course dragging them down, but are not what causes fluctuations in their yearly profitability.*

Now, we know that AMC has done a lot of work to keep rent costs down, and has done massive strides to reduce OPEX. Hence why I strongly think the profitability margins will improve going forward, all else remaining equal. Just look at the int'l markets where OPEX was the reverse (4.3% down y.o.y) and how it made all the difference in their bottom line. Add to that the fact they have gotten rid of a lot of underperforming screens. OPEX should go further down as everyone gets vaccinated and any additional spending on COVID sanitizing is no longer necessary.

**Capex:**

Between 2015-2019 AMC has built 37 new theatres with 310 new screens and bought out 700 theatres and 6,500 screens. They have doubled their capacity in 5 years. That's a lot of CAPEX spending, and obviously a lot of borrowing to deliver that.

Capital spending was $0.5bn in 2019, $0.6bn in 2018 and $0.6bn in 2017. This is resulting to about $300m cash outflows to serve that capex, per year from 2020 and onwards.

It appears that capital spending has stopped, so at least no more new servicing costs.

**Debt:**

2019 = $4.8bn

2020 (9/30): $5.82bn, but we know that in 2021 about $600m was converted to shares, so debt should be about $5.2bn currently. Again, if I've missed any bonds let me know.

**Comparables:**

Price to Book (ttm) and 5yr avrg:

AMC -0.26 / 1.16

MSGE 0.85 / 0.63

CNK 2.41 / 3.12

IMAX 3.34 / 3.54

AMC has the lowest valued share price amongst its competitors, therefore appears the cheapest across the peers. It also trades far lower compares to its 5yr average compared to its peers. Should the tide change it should see its price equalize to the others then there is a great upside. You may say that AMC has a lot of debt etc., well the rest are not in a much better position, with CNK being screwed with Regal for instance.

&amp;#x200B;

# Mementals:

**tl;dr: A lot of positive catalysts await, and every single piece of news will boost the price. Aside a resurge of COVID there is nothing stopping people returning to the theatres, and a slew of blockbusters will be coming out soon to entice them. A change of strategy should also help add some growth to the revenue which will only boost prices further.**

If we were to ignore fundamentals, like the rest of the market does, then we need to look at AMCs potential for popping, squeezing or rallying. I'll start by saying I don't think a short squeeze is in the books. I just doubt it. There's a lot of confusion around its short interest and float. What I do know is that the float has increased a lot compared to early 2020, but it appears that short interest has increased as well. I don't think that shorts have covered to a large extent since mid-Jan and I can see - through checking the IBKR availability of shares to borrow - that shorts are hitting it every day. It's worth noting that its share price is now 100%+ higher than were it was when they were shorting it, so who knows, but I don't count on it.

What I'm thinking is catalysts that will push the price upwards. I do expect that people are just gagging to go back to the cinema. That's not going to change once things reopen. Things that I expect will make the price rally:

\- COVID vaccine roll-out proceeds well and movie studios decide to finally start releasing movies. That should happen once capacity restrictions are lifted at movie theatres. There will be a big marketing push around this in the news.

\- NYC and LA announcing the reopening of theatres at full capacity. This will happen and will happen soon. It will lift the price by a lot as those two are the price revenue makers for AMC.

\- Partnership with a major streaming service. Netflix, Amazon or Disney, or even bought up by a major movie studio. The synergies are insane and the worst case scenario for those giants' balance sheets is negligible. Streaming service subscription numbers are stagnating and streaming giants are forced to increase prices (hi Netflix) to make up for growth. Expanding through an acquisition of AMC makes sense to reach out and grow further. It'll be like Amazon buying up Walmart. Low chance but even chatter about it will push the price up fast.

\- Summer (and Xmas) are the prime seasons where studios release movies. This summer should be huge in terms of releases and times well with the reopening of theatres. This is guaranteed.

\- Wanda converted their shares and is no longer the controlling shareholder. This allows substantial more maneouvering ability to the executive team to do things differently.

\- COVID restrictions lifted sooner than expected. This will allow AMC to use the cash pile it has squirreled for a tough 2021 in repaying debt faster, reducing interest expenses and improving its net income. Any announcement around retiring debt will push the price up.

\- More strategic changes towards PVOD, eSPORTS, booking theatres to people through apps etc. to utilize all the spare seating capacity. Even at peak revenue AMC is only using 17% of its seats, so it's got a lot of idle capacity it can make money off with 0 additional costs. AMC should pivot to additional offerings on top of movie releases to capture more footfall in its screens. I do believe that COVID was a wake up call that will push them to more innovative ways of generating revenue.

\- As people return to theatres they will realize a lot of locals have shut down. There will be consolidation due to natural causes. Fewer screens but the same number of movie-goers. That's a benefit for AMC.

\- With sentiment improving around the economy reopening a lot of these stocks that were hit hard by Covid will get extreme tailwinds that will make them rally. Look at what happened when the Pfizer vaccine was announced with the massive rotation out of tech stocks. I expect similar moves, sooner rather than later. Biden is doing a decent job with vaccine roll out.

I believe that $5 is the new bottom of the share and I think we will be seeing a lot of weekly pops with small pullbacks, basically higher highs and higher lows, going forward. If you actively manage your position you may be able to exit at the high points and reenter at the pullbacks for additional profit.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't see any negatives aside from COVID resurging for some reason. I do believe that the very worst is past for the theatre business.

&amp;#x200B;

**Finally, let me address some common comments:**

\- I got Netflix, why would I go to the movies?

You've had netflix for years, yet you (and everyone else) still goes to the movies. The movies are not gonna die anytime soon. Worst case they won't grow and stagnate, but they are here for years to come.

&amp;#x200B;

\- The studios will just offer their movies to streaming and not to theatres.

Absolute bullshit. Theatres are doing the opposite, pulling out catalogs from netflix. They are in a conundrum as they don't really know what to do. They don't want their movies streaming (because it's far, FAAAAAR less revenue for them) through 3rd parties but at the same time cannot create their own platforms to stream. The latter is just stupid. The CAPEX required to build your own platform is high, and the benefit is trivial since they can play movies in theatres and keep the majority of the ticket price. Besides, streaming movies only works for low budget films. Any blockbuster requires the cinematic experience. Very few people have top-model TVs at home with surround sound, and even if they do, 4K streamed over the internet results to sub-par quality. It just does not compare to the cinema quality. The only realistic alternative to cinema for home entertainment is having a top of the line tv+sound+bluray. But that's not streaming is it?

If streaming was to kill off theatres then VHS, DVD and Bluray would have done so before (Studios would have released straight to DVD, why didn't they?). It never happened and for good reason. People go to the movies because of a) The cinematic experience, b) they combine it with a night out, c) it's a way of socializing and much more. That won't go away. Btw, Disney, despite having a streaming platform decided to go ahead with theatrical releases of all its movies in 2021, and won't offer them on streaming at the same time. Get it now?

Another reason why that won't work = Look at Disney, they offered Mulan through their own platform, so what best example to examine. They did not offer it as part of the subscription, so forget about paying your monthly neftlix and having new movies for free. They instead priced it at about 2x movie tickets. Even if they are to continue that with their next releases it's not really that much more affordable compared to going to the movies, is it? So don't expect Universal or 20th Century offering you all their new movies for $10/month. Ain't gonna happen.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Theatres have been open since August but noone is going

Noone is going not only because of COVID concerns, but there are no movies to see. You need studios to release their movies for people to return. I don't expect them to do so until restrictions are lifted and everyone can safely return to the theatres.

&amp;#x200B;

\- So, what else besides James Bond is coming in 2021? why would I go to the cinema for just 1 movie.

You are an idiot. Here is a list of upcoming blockbuster releases: [https://qz.com/1948011/the-2021-movie-calendar-previews-hollywoods-new-normal/](https://qz.com/1948011/the-2021-movie-calendar-previews-hollywoods-new-normal/)

Look at summer time onwards, there is a hot movie almost every week. Most of the movies in the first half will likely be released in the second half after all, making it a bonanza of new films coming out in summer onwards.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Theatres are dead in the long term, aren't they?

We are all dead in the long term. I don't care. Let's focus in the next six months ok? My investment horizon for AMC is up to the end of 2021 the latest. In a best case scenario I expect the recovery to be fully priced in by summer time when I will exit or just start selling CCs again. I may exit/renter several times to what I think may be short-term peaks and troughs. I'm not Buffett so I'm not buying for life. I'm in this for the rally to normalcy.

# Real Estate Play?

Wait... they just take pictures of houses and shet. idgaf. Housing market gonna crash and we're all gonna kiss Burry's ass again. Trash play. 

Well... sort of, let's do an analogy. 

If stonks go up, who makes money?

1. Bulls
2. The brokers earning commission from you apes

If stonks go down, who makes money?

1.  🌈 🐻
2. The brokers earning commission from you apes

Matterport is the tool that brokers use. They have contracts with Redfin, apartments.com, vacasa, etc

Listing sites like Zillow and Airbnb also support user uploaded Matterport imaging.

Buy, sell, rent, hotel, BnB, market up, market down, ERRYTHANG!

In other words, they're gonna make money regardless of real estate market.

# Stats:

bigger numbers lead to bigger tendies

total revenue: $26.9mill (+108% YoY)

Subscribers: 331,000 (+500+% YoY) 

\# of Spaces under Matterport Management: 5 mill +

Annual Recurring Revenue: $55+ million

150+ countries and counting

# Covid/Recovery Play:

Is it too late to play covid? maybe, but Florida thinks otherwise.

Online shopping/home improvement: Rather than annoying the living shet outta amazon by returning the 9/10 items you just bought, you can virtually place the item in your home and see how it fits or looks. 

When you're stuck at home gong crazy staring at the wall, you might plan your next trip. Resorts, hotels, parks, vacation sites. While everyone is stuck at home, these places'll use Matterport to instill as much FOMO as they can to get customers to line up once the pandemic is over. 

# Other Streams of Revenue/Applications:

Retail: You ever buy something at Ikea, bring it home, assemble it, and find out it doesn't fit correctly or it doesn't match the fungshui of your living room? Neither have I, but I'm sure someone has. And Matterport can help you see whether your curtains will match that bean bag you always wanted. Aside from this, retailers have instructions from corporate on their store layout and shelving. Matterport will play a big role in facilitating this so that these managers don't have to drive/fly to every city in their jurisdiction. 

VR/AR: They have a deal with Face mother f-ing Book. That deal was just for research and AI. You know what else FB owns? Oculus. MTTR can easily enter VR/AR space with their technology to enter the gaming and 'adult' industries.

# Short Interest:

IDGAF about the short interest. They're gonna make bank and that'll lead to me to making bank. I like the stock. and tbh, I'm such an ape, I don't even know how to reliably check short interest. I just like the stock. Ima just put random words other apes like. squeeze. tendies. shitadel. hedgies fuk'd. moon. rocket. banana.

# PR: 

If you create the world's best invention; you'll still be dirt poor if no one knows about it. The same goes with stocks. Matterport just hired 2 new PR specialists in the past 2 months - a VP of Investor relations Soohwan Kim, and VP International marketing, Vivian Weiying Pan. If you didn't know about Matterport before, you'll know about it now. More people = more investors = stonks going up

I just like the stock. Ima just put random words other apes like. squeeze. tendies. shitadel. hedgies fuk'd. moon. rocket. banana.

# PR: 

If you create the world's best invention; you'll still be dirt poor if no one knows about it. The same goes with stocks. Matterport just hired 2 new PR specialists in the past 2 months - a VP of Investor relations Soohwan Kim, and VP International marketing, Vivian Weiying Pan. If you didn't know about Matterport before, you'll know about it now. More people = more investors = stonks going up

&amp;#x200B;

There is a TLDR after each section for more in depth details. Or a very broad TLDR at end.

# The Drone (CON)

1. ""Horse Fly"" is Work Horses last mile delivery drone launched from their delivery vehicle. Sounds great in theory and this is exactly what we expected the future to hold, right? Sure. As a consumer though do you really want your package to be dropped in your [front yard](https://youtu.be/05BaPqBXNT0?t=207) and have to walk to pick up your package or have a person put in literally in front of your door? A loud drone is also a huge ""HEY COME STEAL MY PACKAGE"" alarm.
   1. ""Horse Fly"" Me, the OP, being a student Pilot, I knew about airspaces and can Horse Fly even fly in the majority of US Airspace? Turns out they actually can, they claim on their website they have worked with the FAA to obtain permission which is a major PRO. As stated on their website: **""The HorseFly system is designed to conform to the FAA guidelines for UAV operation in the U.S. ""**
      1. However, you cannot really use this system in any densely populated area (like new york) for the simple fact you don't want drones flying around 10lb packages above thousands of humans heads all day. That's a lawsuit begging to happen.

2. The drone is limited to a 10lb payload, this even further reduces the actual amount of packages   
it will be able to deliver. Ultimately this drone is pretty fucking useless as it's only use is in very sparsely populated areas or small suburban areas.

(1) **Tl;dr:**

The drones cannot be utilized everywhere in the USA, which greatly restricts their abilities considering the [majority of the US population lives in just a few different locations](http://ecpmlangues.u-strasbg.fr/civilization/geography/maps/US%20Population%20density,%202010.png) anywhere dark red would likely be unable for this drone. Drones are maintenance heavy and seem to still require human intervention. I just cant see the ultimate viability of drones compared to a human. Would be loud and attract thieves, and annoy customers.

# Continued Revenue (CON)

2.How will Work Horse continue to make money after i.e UPS buys all the trucks they want? Obviously UPS is not interested in buying the newest model every year, which means no new revenue for Work Horse. So what about maintenance? It appears as though Work Horse contracts out maintenance through Ryder Systems. [https://ryder.com/locations](https://ryder.com/locations). This would imply Work Horse will not be making money from maintenance.

1. Drone Maintenance? I haven't found anything on their website about this, but would it really be worth it for UPS to have to be constantly shipping these drones back to Work Horse for repairs and needing to keep extra drones on hand and constantly accessible? Or just pay a driver who is significantly more reliable? 

&amp;#x200B;

(2) **Tl;dr:**

Theres **no real potential for continued revenue** after workhorse sells a company their initial fleet, workhorse wont be the ones doing maintenance and the customer company wont be interested in a new fleet of the newest model each year.

&amp;#x200B;

# Charging Costs (CON)

[reuters.com](https://reuters.com) Did an article about workhorse charging costs. **""Developing the battery plants and charging infrastructure to fund an electrified global vehicle fleet could require an investment of $2.7 trillion by manufacturers and governments "".**  Workhorse does not have anywhere near the required capital to build charging stations, which would likely leave the cost for UPS to cover. Not to mention EV doesn't change a god damn thing, we will create the electricity for the EV's by burning coal LOL [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ups-workhorse-group-electric-vehicles/ups-workhorse-electric-van-deal-shows-progress-on-charging-costs-idUSKCN1G61RZ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ups-workhorse-group-electric-vehicles/ups-workhorse-electric-van-deal-shows-progress-on-charging-costs-idUSKCN1G61RZ)

(3) T**l;dr** Infrastructure required will likely be so significantly expensive that the cost would never be recouped over any realistic time frame from the money being saved between electricity and petroleum costs by a customer company (like UPS). Besides, electricity on this size scale will be significantly more expensive than petroleum which just means you're consistently losing money by switching to an EV fleet.

&amp;#x200B;

# Why Q4 FY 2020 Was so high (CON)

 "" **Sales for the fourth quarter of 2020 were recorded at $652,000 compared to $3,000 in the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in sales was due to a higher volume of trucks produced and delivered.** "" [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/01/2184359/0/en/Workhorse-Group-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/01/2184359/0/en/Workhorse-Group-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results.html). The majority of this large increase was actually due to an investment workhorse made in $RIDE. The only quarters that will generate a profit is those that WKHS made a good investment or sold vehicles, they have no recurring or stable revenue source. 

&amp;#x200B;

# The MOASS (MAJOR PRO)

This stock has a huge potential for the Mother of All Short Squeezes. From [marketbeat.com](https://marketbeat.com) they claim 38.5% of workhorses shares are shorted. This is massive, and literally we just caught the shorts with their [pants down](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ns4bqz/amc_ceo_shows_us_he_isnt_wearing_pants/).

&amp;#x200B;

# So why the fuck did you buy it then?

Because bitch, do you really think Tesla would've been able to do anything without their price surging? Fuck no, but the unlimited money glitch Elon discovered unlocked so many opportunities. 

  
IF WKHS Gets squeezed to the moon, they can raise a massive amount of capital to dump into R&amp;D and make their company an actual viable alternative option to petroleum vehicle fleets. But as it stands now, it's a really dog shit company with a dim future, no scalability and no continued revenue.

&amp;#x200B;

# Overall TL;DR:

Workhorse is a shit company in the long term and will never be able to scale appropriately given their current capital, but the short-term short squeeze could provide capital to make it a not shit company and allow for workhorse to build their own maintenance shops, charging stations, and dealerships around the US which will provide a stable revenue source.

&amp;#x200B;

**DISCLAIMER**

Don't sue me because of your own personal decisions on the free-market this isn't financial advice, and **I don't guarantee anything in the post to be true or accurate.** I don't intend to influence any decision, this is simply information I collected to share with my fellow apes.",Work Horse DD,77,1,"Work Horse DD **With the growing talk about a potential Work Horse short squeeze I looked into the company and here's what I think about it, and why I bought: TLDR at bottom**

This F/Y I created a relatively diverse portfolio and went from a nice and steady gain of around ~50% since May to about -50% from my initial investment as of tonight. I thought I was making the right calls until I wasn't. No I'm not gonna post loss porn but I've got for letters for you..  H Y L N 😃🔫. Got f'd so hard I can still feel it weeks later. So yeah feel free to keep reading cuz I'm a fucking idiot and you might get a kick out of this.

So. GME. If you're still reading...


BULL CASE, NO SQUEEZE:

if we consider the company's

-cash in hand (i.e. ability to stay afloat)
-sold out pre-orders on the new consoles
-brand awareness (how many of us bought something from GameStop as a child? I bought a LOT of shit from GameStop as a kid and I want my fucking money back so I'm in as I'm sure a lot of others are in for a similar reason)
-constant cost cutting by way of closing down locations which aren't making money
-change of management 
-involvement of Michael Burry (i watched the Big Short and thats all the DD we really need here let's be honest..
-institutional investors holding a signification amount of shares and not selling even after such ridiculous rallies
-GameStop's attempt at pivoting to e-commerce
-Microsoft deal
-rumoured Sony deal
-potential for further deal(s) with more big names
-increasing retail interest
-retail investors looking for the next success story
-premium meme status

I think the stock price (without any sort of squeeze action) will sit around $30 to $50 by the time earnings from the new consoles come into play. This puts the company at a market cap of around $2bn to $3.5bn, respectively - a fairly reasonable valuation compared to previous gaming cycles and taking all aforementioned factors into consideration (and assuming they all go in favour of GME i.e. no bad news, no scandals, no big investors selling off, smashing earnings reports etc, securing further deals).

This valuation MAY be achievable solely based on earnings from new consoles and other products, as well as a successful pivot to e-commerce. However, I personally believe the valuation of $2bn to $3.5bn is contingent on some sort of catalytic news (i.e. more deals with the likes of Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo) carrying the price to the $20 to $25 range PRIOR to the console earnings coming into play. If such a catalyst occurs in time, it may provide the stock with a new floor around $20 to $25 (making the valuation sit at around $1.3bn to roughly $1.6bn) as more retail investors start to take notice.

BULL CASE WITH SQUEEZE: assuming that a short squeeze actually takes place, God only knows where it could end up. I REALLY like that one guy's PT of $500 but that's probably not going to happen. With that being said, I can't even fathom what a short squeeze with 170% short interest could actually do to a stock like this.. Please, someone with ACTUAL knowledge of the market feel free to chime in here. 

So... PT with the turnaround story, securing new deals/partnerships with big companies, increase in retail interest, AND some squeeze action on the side?? $100 to infinity. 


-----


BEAR CASE: the company has been in decline for about 6 years. When we consider WHY the stock is trading so low, one wonders why would it suddenly become worth even $1bn, let alone $2bn to $3.5bn. The rise of e-commerce and now with the ultimate fuck you from the universe (covid) to brick-and-mortar stores.. it's really no wonder why the company is doing so terribly. They may continue to trade at these elevated prices running up to and through the console cycle, but it will not last. This is because making a breakout in the e-commerce sector will be nearly impossible because of Amazon (worldwide), eBay (worldwide) GAME (UK/Europe), and large supermarket chains like Tesco (UK), Asda (UK) and Costco (USA/UK) already having a pretty solid grasp on the market in their respective territories. 

Additionally, as mentioned above, the bull case is contingent on so many factors that it is more likely to continue declining in the mid to long term rather than trending up by any significant measure. Contrary to what a lot of people are thinking, the bear case is actually supported by the ridiculous short interest. Why would so many people be betting against a stock with such passion (170% shorted ffs) if they didn't absolutely believe that they are right and that GME is done for? At least one really solid catalyst WILL be required to push the stock up significantly. It seems that the Microsoft deal was not a significant enough catalyst make the share price moon. So how far up is another deal REALLY likely to push the share price?

Also, If there is no such catalyst until new console earnings come into play, or if big investors start pulling out at ANY point, the stock MAY still spike as console earnings come into play, however, it most likely will not hold above $25 and will crash hard as fuck when people start taking profits/realise what's about to happen.

Also, why would this console cycle affect GME the same way as it previous cycles? We now have so many options to choose from when it comes to buying ANYTHING let alone games or consoles. Of course, Amazon won't be able to fulfil every single order. GameStop WILL pull in hella revenue as demonstrated by the selling out of BOTH waves of PS5 preorders. However, the effect on the share price will not be the same. We will most likely see some huge spikes leading up to/after earnings, but it will be short-lived as people will see that GameStop is one of MANY retailers offering competitive prices for the same items and as supply and demand meet an equilibrium. 

Also.. what do most people do when they can't find something at their go-to store? Most people I know would look at Amazon or eBay rather than waiting it out. This will pull a lot of revenue away from GameStop as other retailors will fill the gaps and reduce the prospects of revenue growth over time. This, in turn, will make the stock price tumble once again, and probably harder than it ever has because this may be GameStop's last shot at turning it around.

Ultimately, I think if any sort of a bear scenario plays out, we could be looking at 52-week low within the next few weeks (I personally don't hold this opinion as I need to keep believing to remain sane).

I could keep talking in circles about why the stock is/isn't gonna moon and who's gonna get fucked the hardest; bears or bulls, respectively. Every reason FOR either side can be easily followed up with an argument AGAINST it.

I would personally really like it if someone could pump the stock so hard that shorts start covering, causing a domino effect of shorts covering their positions (and their asses), leading to ultimate short squeeze so I can finally make a little bit (or a lot) of money. But for all we know, this shit could crash so hard I might never be able to bring myself to trade again.

Having said that... I've aggregated a list of some potential short-interest plays that haven't popped off. If you like any of the tickers mentioned here I suggest you research if they are capable of a turn-around story (most will be shorted for a reason). The factors for the stocks that made it to today's list are:

1. Chart looks decent and the stock hasn't already gone up 50% or more (aka already missed the boat)

2. Some bullish option flow came in today and the stock price was somewhat flat or down.

3. Is short interest **increasing** or **decreasing** as the stock goes up or down? If the stock is getting hit (going down) and SI is increasing, it's quite *possible* these shorts will eventually cover their position at some point.

**The tickers list is:** WKHS, QS, OCGN, FUBO, ROOT, BGS, ROOT, SDC

&amp;#x200B;

Keep in mind the FIRST thing I check with option flow is the expiration of the larger trades. If it's within 1 or 2 weeks I don't usually like to give it much credit. These could mean literally anything: a hedge, riding momentum, etc. I prefer seeing stuff 3-12 months out for a long-term play.

**Final Thoughts**

Some of these stocks might have popped 10-25% in the short-term, but if you zoom out to 6 months you'll see they are still down quite a bit and have been heavily shorted. If any of these were on your radar it might put into perspective the chart and level of short-interest for each ticker.

Blink Charging (BLNK) is a small cap American EV charging provider with a value of 1.45 billion. It has been rallying from a around $1 dollar to a yearly high of $64.00 but in the last couple months has dropped in value by almost half to $34.00 due to a rising short interest amongst hedge funds to around 41% making it one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the Nasdaq right now. Not sure what hedge funds are short but I feel there are a few reasons for this.

The main reason for this is that there are a number of other competitors that are making inroads in the market and that BLNK is relatively small amount of market share at 8% at current. Chargepoint is the largest in the market. Although I feel that that what the hedge funds have overlooked is that there should be room for loads of companys in the EV charging industry. The sheer rate of growth in the EV market has driven this company up 1200% and that has potential to keep going. BLNK has implemented a total of 15,760 charging stations and Apple has added all these stations to its Apple Maps which is massive for the company. We also should not underestimate the radical change to the global economy where clean energy is going to overtake traditional fossil fuels. America has a target I believe of 2035 for the phase out of fossil fuel transport while most of Europe has pledged to transform its economy to be carbon neutral by 2030 with EVs playing a major part in that shift. This indicates that there is huge upside for the company in the coming years.💎🙌

Below I have highlighted a few of the fundamentals that are interesting and may look familar here including the current short interest (42%) and the current float 32 million. Thats around 20 million LESS than GME currently. 💎🙌

Also I checked on iborrowdesk where there is currently 45,000 shorts available very similar to GME at the moment although the borrow fee can be as high as 80%?? 

Here is where I got these numbers from if people want to expand on this.

However I do think that there is reason to claim the stock is undervalued regardless of what the squeeze potential may be if that sanario was to play out.

I am noticing that of the 457 million XLE shares outstanding, 41.64% are owned by institutional ETFs/ETPs...that leaves 190 million shares actually floating around out there.

When I take a look at the April 16th open interest and add it all up...if XLE, by some miracle, was able to close at $55, this would mean dealers are on the hook to deliver 42 million shares. If it were able to close at a more reasonable $51, this would still be 21 million shares.

When I look at Ortex, I see that on March 23, there were 55.8 million sold short...this has come down now, to 34.7 million. There's a lot of open interest on the put side, and we all know that when options dealers sell puts, they are forced to sell shares short in order to delta hedge...and then as the price comes up, they cover those shorts to remained delta neutral.

So I'm not proposing that there is some kind of fantastic short squeeze on the way here, but I am wondering if anyone has any thoughts about the possibility of getting a little bit of a gamma squeeze and some dealer short covering to propel XLE next week. I'm already very irresponsibly long XLE and XLF calls expiring next Friday, I'm flirting with the idea of throwing some more good money after bad and buying more cheap calls today to see if something happens.

So first let me get some things straight. I’m not saying this could become another GME, but if it reaches even 10% of the GME potential then we might have a really good play here.

&amp;#x200B;

**Chamath** is one of the big investors in this stock. CLOV was made public through one of his SPAC’S. I know lots of apes hate him, sure he should have diamond-handed GME. But should that be the reason not to buy CLOV? His track record is incredible nonetheless!

* A little more about the investment Chamath made! Short-term-wise, he can’t pull out his investment as he did with $SPCE because his lock-up expires in July 2021. I have to say that he wouldn’t jeopardize his reputations if he thought Clover was a scam and didn’t see the potentials.

&amp;#x200B;

**Vivek Garipalli** is the co-founder and CEO of Clover Health. Prior to founding CLOV, he founded CarePoint Health in 2008, a fully integrated healthcare system in New Jersey. He owns 83.5m shares in CLOV which is classified as class B shares which is looked until the price reached $30$ for a period of 90 consecutive days. In his early days he worked as an Healthcare Investment Banker at Credit Suisse, he also has worked at Blackstone Group and JPMorgan Partners.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Clover Health?** Well, it’s an insurance company providing cheaper solutions for customers, but with a focus on the individual. In their own words: “Clover’s Medicare Advantage plans are built on technology from the ground-up. Integrating our systems with doctors, clinicians, and nurse practitioners, Clover’s data team helps healthcare professionals in the field intervene directly into patients’ wellness to help them avoid acute health episodes.”

* The development of this software is led by the Andrew Toy the President and Chief Technology Officer at CLOV and a former Product Director from Google, working with things such as Develop Platforms, Develop Ecosystems and AI/Machine Intelligence.

&amp;#x200B;

* What’s the difference between Clover health and Original Medicare? Original Medicare covers some of the costs of hospitals and doctor visits but does not cover prescription drugs or vision, dental, or hearing care. It can have high copays and coinsurance, which can lead to high costs if a beneficiary needs to go to the hospital. Clover’s Medicare Advantage PPO plan covers hospitals and doctor visits like Original Medicare, as well as prescription coverage and additional benefits aimed at keeping members healthy – all at a low cost and on an open network.

&amp;#x200B;

* Besides being an insurance company, CLOV also seeks to develop the industry’s best, most well-informed, and useful physician assistant tool to empower its partners to deliver better primary care to Clover members. They focus on PCPs because they are the trusted quarterback of each member’s care that have the most significant impact on their care journeys. Arming them with relevant patient information and data-driven insights empowers them to take better care of Clover’s members.

&amp;#x200B;

**Now to the fun part, the numbers!**

&amp;#x200B;

**Public Float:** 109M; The biggest 3 combined owns 33M shares (Vanguard 26.1M, Black Rock – 2M, Baillie Gifford &amp; Co– 5M: They are either mutual fund &amp; long-term, so it is highly unlikely they will sell in short term. This also makes it way harder for short sellers to fully cover their short positions as they would need a lot of shares which is locked up in these mutual funds.

**Revenue:** In 2020 they made $672.9m with a net loss of $92.7m and $462.3m in 2019 with a net loss of $181.5m. Revenue grew 46% from 2019 to 2020! Guidance for 2021 is $820-850m that’s a YoY growth of \~24.1%. They expect to be fully profitable in 2023, pretty impressive! Compared to the average 8-9% growth YoY in the medical insurance sector CLOV is doing way better!

**EBITDA** may not be sexy, but they can easily beat EPS for sure. They will flush $44.8M gain on derivatives in Q1 (officially published), which can shoot up net income. Also, they flushed all the unnecessary expenses/losses in Q4 (i.e. I-P-O-C and CLOV Merger legal costs, etc…. In Q1, 2020, they had a loss of 28M. So this one-time boost on derivatives in Q1 will beat the EPS estimate (at least for Q1). Also, they said they will increase their guidance - per the linked publication.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f4a9il0d04y61.png?width=2346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2174d92db10eaba3718379314e7ce74be1b0cc6

&amp;#x200B;

**Option Interest on Calls:** 601,034 (multiply by 100, which is 60M) - Gamma Squeeze. (Total) 350k of those expire in May. The options table looks ideal for a potential gamma squeeze, have a look in the picture below. As you can see there’s lots of open interest for almost every strike! Short sellers and the total call OI is around 107m shares if all calls become ITM. This would literally make it impossible for naked call sellers and short sellers to cover their position because of the low public float of 109m shares!

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xdtvus3e04y61.png?width=1310&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6606fb497bdeecbf1d16e79b6d553936335bdd3d

&amp;#x200B;

**Short interest:** As of Friday the SI% of the float was 43.48% or 47m shares sold short. (source: S3 partners) This is quite a lot, actually the top 3 most shorted US stocks! The funny thing about this is that the price went up close to 5% even though shorties added another 2m shares to their short position. The SI% of float has gone up almost every day to keep the price down! However, HF’s are digging their own graves by doing that!

https://preview.redd.it/4iy1xxjf04y61.png?width=1124&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6aef16302c77a723226aece12c2c75d487fa94c

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Total call OI and shorted shares** are almost the same as the entire public float. Keep in mind that out of the public float of 109m, around 33m of those is locked up within the top 3 biggest investors. Bringing the actual free float down to 76m shares. This would make it nearly impossible for the short sellers to cover the 47.7m shares they shorted.

https://preview.redd.it/0jmhtglg04y61.png?width=608&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e71646759dca08ce9fd2da917df085d7d19b4e0d

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Short-Term Q1 Earning Call (Positive Catalyst - Facts)** \- 58,040 enrollment as of Dec 2020 increased to 66,395 enrollment as of April 2021 (they released earlier in April). So far, this increased 14% compared to the prior year (i.e. their revenue is also expected to increase by 14% from $166M in Dec to $189M in Mar 2021. Note that their annual guidance is 68K – 70K, so we are already halfway there meeting the target, excluding the CMS contract in 10 states (that opens the door up to 200,000, which was already approved and started on April 1) There was an email from Andrew (IR guy), he said that he will release at the right time (Quiet period until ER, so I would assume this will be released on ER. If not, when is Andrew ever going to release this positive news officially.

&amp;#x200B;

\- As of today there are 117 open job positions on Clover Health's website! Definitely a sign of growth

\- Lowering the age of Medicare to 60 from 65 would add another 23m Americans to the TAM. In money that equals around $250b more! This would definitely help CLOV expand further.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* In 2021, the Government would open the MA enrollment period for the whole year, so you can expect more people to enroll throughout 2021. - April 1, 2021 – Clover issued an 8-K statement to correct loss on derivative from $(51.1) million to $(6.3) million. This is a one-time adjustment that occurred after Dec 31, so this will get flushed as an adjustment in Q1. This is material because considering their budgeted M-C-R of 92.6%, Q1 profit is expected to be $13M (based on high-level calculations). This adjustment is 4 times that of profit/loss, so it will boost profits substantially in Q1 and the outlook of YTD 2021. (Note – if you are a long-term investor, you shouldn’t care too much about this because this is just paper profit. But, because analysts’ price target is based on the bottom line DCF, this will substantially boost their price target, further increase the price target). So, in Q1, Clover Health is expected to be in a net profit position Q1 instead of loss, which is impressive for a start-up.

&amp;#x200B;

**So if everything sounds so great why is the stock price 50% down from Dec/Jan highs?** Well, there’s a couple of reason why.

&amp;#x200B;

* Money flowing out of Growth stocks and SPACS
* Manipulation from short sellers (Very high SI)
* Hindenburg short report, down below is a further explanation to this report.

&amp;#x200B;

The short report by Hindenburg covers some issues regarding a DOJ investigation and points out the losses over the year. There’s some more minor stuff besides this.

The DOJ investigation looks to have been sorted out, they will probably announce something regarding this in the upcoming ER. The losses Hindenburg is pointing out are to be expected for a newly started company, and in my eyes, this is nothing to worry about as the company states they will be profitable in the fiscal year 2023. In fact, they already cut losses in half from 2019 to 2020, while generating 46% more revenue, impressive.

&amp;#x200B;

**After the short report by Hindenburg short-sellers beat the crap out of CLOV**

&amp;#x200B;

* CLOV responded to this in a long report, and the CEO Vivek Garipall went on a phone call with Forbes saying:

&amp;#x200B;

*“There is no more real person than I am about this shit,” he contended, casting himself as an honest broker in a “fucked up” healthcare market during a meandering phone call. “And I don’t care, like, publish whatever. But don’t publish stuff without people like us being able to comment and tell you what we think.”*

&amp;#x200B;

* This is a CEO that would do anything for his company, his shares are even locked up until the price reaches $30 for a period of 90 days!

**Next week,** when they release short interest info from NASDAQ (Tues AH), May MA enrollments and earnings (May 17, PM), and options expiry date on May 21… can you feel something big and positive will come in the next few weeks? I sure as hell can!

&amp;#x200B;

**Macro-wise,** NASDAQ had a little correction this week (today’s job report sort of kicked rotation from value to growth). Also, hopefully, after Elon’s SNL this weekend, that crypt-o capital will gradually flow into the stock market, especially already beat-up small/medium growth stocks with WSB “short &amp; gamma squeeze” candidate).

&amp;#x200B;

**Bearish case:**

* Increasing competition in the space
* Legacy companies VS CLOV
* From 46% YoY growth to \~24% guidance growth for 2021 (however this is really early still, we would need q1 to see updates on this, may surprise?)
* Potential Nasdaq correction

&amp;#x200B;

**Bonus info:** Alphabet (Google) backed CLOV with a $500m investment. Walmart and CLOV recently made a partnership. Demetrios Kouzoukas joins BOD.

&amp;#x200B;

**Analyst ratings:**

* Citigroup buy with a PT of $19
* Credit Suisse neutral with a PT of $10
* JP Morgan neutral with a PT of $15

So right now we are trading below all analyst ratings.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** CLOV is currently below its NAV and even further away from the average PT set by analysts.This is a company with huge success and a bright future ahead of it, in one of the hottest sectors under the Democrats! The potential downside is very low, as we are already near the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ways to get in**

* Bullgang  

   * Buy shares (Low risk)
   * Buy calls (Medium/high risk)
   * Vertical Bull Debit Call Spread - Buy a ATM call, sell OTM calls. (Low/medium risk)  

      * Example: Buy 1x $10 call at $0.40 (May 21, 2021), Sell 1x $12.5 call at $0.20 (May 21, 2021) 1 contract = 100 shares. Therefore, the maxium risk is $20 for each contract, and max potential gain is $230.

&amp;#x200B;

* Thetagang  

   * Sell cash-secured puts (Low risk)
   * Buy shares sell CC's (Low risk)

&amp;#x200B;

**My price predictions**. If we get a little gamma squeeze I see this go to around $40-60 If we get a full-blown gamma squeeze combined with a short squeeze I could see this go to $75+ Without a gamma squeeze I see this at $15-30 before May 21st. **Please do your own DD before investing**, I’m not a financial adviser. And this is not financial advice. I just would like a Lambo and quit my job

For the apes out there 🚀🚀🚀

**Position:** 81x $11 calls expiring in June, 3x $10 calls expiring in May and 10x $15 calls expiring in May.",Next level DD: CLOV,192,1,"Next level DD: CLOV **\*TL;DR at the bottom**

So first let me get some things straight. I’m not saying this could become another GME, but if it reaches even 10% of the GME potential then we might have a really good play here.

&amp;#x200B;

**Chamath** is one of the big investors in this stock. CLOV was made public through one of his SPAC’S. I know lots of apes hate him, sure he should have diamond-handed GME. But should that be the reason not to buy CLOV? His track record is incredible nonetheless!

* A little more about the investment Chamath made! Short-term-wise, he can’t pull out his investment as he did with $SPCE because his lock-up expires in July 2021. I have to say that he wouldn’t jeopardize his reputations if he thought Clover was a scam and didn’t see the potentials.

&amp;#x200B;

**Vivek Garipalli** is the co-founder and CEO of Clover Health. Prior to founding CLOV, he founded CarePoint Health in 2008, a fully integrated healthcare system in New Jersey. He owns 83.5m shares in CLOV which is classified as class B shares which is looked until the price reached $30$ for a period of 90 consecutive days. In his early days he worked as an Healthcare Investment Banker at Credit Suisse, he also has worked at Blackstone Group and JPMorgan Partners.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Clover Health?** Well, it’s an insurance company providing cheaper solutions for customers, but with a focus on the individual. In their own words: “Clover’s Medicare Advantage plans are built on technology from the ground-up. Integrating our systems with doctors, clinicians, and nurse practitioners, Clover’s data team helps healthcare professionals in the field intervene directly into patients’ wellness to help them avoid acute health episodes.”

* The development of this software is led by the Andrew Toy the President and Chief Technology Officer at CLOV and a former Product Director from Google, working with things such as Develop Platforms, Develop Ecosystems and AI/Machine Intelligence.

&amp;#x200B;

* What’s the difference between Clover health and Original Medicare? Original Medicare covers some of the costs of hospitals and doctor visits but does not cover prescription drugs or vision, dental, or hearing care. It can have high copays and coinsurance, which can lead to high costs if a beneficiary needs to go to the hospital. Clover’s Medicare Advantage PPO plan covers hospitals and doctor visits like Original Medicare, as well as prescription coverage and additional benefits aimed at keeping members healthy – all at a low cost and on an open network.

&amp;#x200B;

* Besides being an insurance company, CLOV also seeks to develop the industry’s best, most well-informed, and useful physician assistant tool to empower its partners to deliver better primary care to Clover members. They focus on PCPs because they are the trusted quarterback of each member’s care that have the most significant impact on their care journeys. Arming them with relevant patient information and data-driven insights empowers them to take better care of Clover’s members.

&amp;#x200B;

**Now to the fun part, the numbers!**

&amp;#x200B;

**Public Float:** 109M; The biggest 3 combined owns 33M shares (Vanguard 26.1M, Black Rock – 2M, Baillie Gifford &amp; Co– 5M: They are either mutual fund &amp; long-term, so it is highly unlikely they will sell in short term. This also makes it way harder for short sellers to fully cover their short positions as they would need a lot of shares which is locked up in these mutual funds.

**Revenue:** In 2020 they made $672.9m with a net loss of $92.7m and $462.3m in 2019 with a net loss of $181.5m. Revenue grew 46% from 2019 to 2020! Guidance for 2021 is $820-850m that’s a YoY growth of \~24.1%. They expect to be fully profitable in 2023, pretty impressive! Compared to the average 8-9% growth YoY in the medical insurance sector CLOV is doing way better!

**EBITDA** may not be sexy, but they can easily beat EPS for sure. They will flush $44.8M gain on derivatives in Q1 (officially published), which can shoot up net income. Also, they flushed all the unnecessary expenses/losses in Q4 (i.e. I-P-O-C and CLOV Merger legal costs, etc…. In Q1, 2020, they had a loss of 28M. So this one-time boost on derivatives in Q1 will beat the EPS estimate (at least for Q1). Also, they said they will increase their guidance - per the linked publication.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f4a9il0d04y61.png?width=2346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2174d92db10eaba3718379314e7ce74be1b0cc6

&amp;#x200B;

**Option Interest on Calls:** 601,034 (multiply by 100, which is 60M) - Gamma Squeeze. (Total) 350k of those expire in May. The options table looks ideal for a potential gamma squeeze, have a look in the picture below. As you can see there’s lots of open interest for almost every strike! Short sellers and the total call OI is around 107m shares if all calls become ITM. This would literally make it impossible for naked call sellers and short sellers to cover their position because of the low public float of 109m shares!

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xdtvus3e04y61.png?width=1310&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6606fb497bdeecbf1d16e79b6d553936335bdd3d

&amp;#x200B;

**Short interest:** As of Friday the SI% of the float was 43.48% or 47m shares sold short. (source: S3 partners) This is quite a lot, actually the top 3 most shorted US stocks! The funny thing about this is that the price went up close to 5% even though shorties added another 2m shares to their short position. The SI% of float has gone up almost every day to keep the price down! However, HF’s are digging their own graves by doing that!

https://preview.redd.it/4iy1xxjf04y61.png?width=1124&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6aef16302c77a723226aece12c2c75d487fa94c

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Total call OI and shorted shares** are almost the same as the entire public float. Keep in mind that out of the public float of 109m, around 33m of those is locked up within the top 3 biggest investors. Bringing the actual free float down to 76m shares. This would make it nearly impossible for the short sellers to cover the 47.7m shares they shorted.

https://preview.redd.it/0jmhtglg04y61.png?width=608&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e71646759dca08ce9fd2da917df085d7d19b4e0d

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Short-Term Q1 Earning Call (Positive Catalyst - Facts)** \- 58,040 enrollment as of Dec 2020 increased to 66,395 enrollment as of April 2021 (they released earlier in April). So far, this increased 14% compared to the prior year (i.e. their revenue is also expected to increase by 14% from $166M in Dec to $189M in Mar 2021. Note that their annual guidance is 68K – 70K, so we are already halfway there meeting the target, excluding the CMS contract in 10 states (that opens the door up to 200,000, which was already approved and started on April 1) There was an email from Andrew (IR guy), he said that he will release at the right time (Quiet period until ER, so I would assume this will be released on ER. If not, when is Andrew ever going to release this positive news officially.

&amp;#x200B;

\- As of today there are 117 open job positions on Clover Health's website! Definitely a sign of growth

\- Lowering the age of Medicare to 60 from 65 would add another 23m Americans to the TAM. In money that equals around $250b more! This would definitely help CLOV expand further.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* In 2021, the Government would open the MA enrollment period for the whole year, so you can expect more people to enroll throughout 2021. - April 1, 2021 – Clover issued an 8-K statement to correct loss on derivative from $(51.1) million to $(6.3) million. This is a one-time adjustment that occurred after Dec 31, so this will get flushed as an adjustment in Q1. This is material because considering their budgeted M-C-R of 92.6%, Q1 profit is expected to be $13M (based on high-level calculations). This adjustment is 4 times that of profit/loss, so it will boost profits substantially in Q1 and the outlook of YTD 2021. (Note – if you are a long-term investor, you shouldn’t care too much about this because this is just paper profit. But, because analysts’ price target is based on the bottom line DCF, this will substantially boost their price target, further increase the price target). So, in Q1, Clover Health is expected to be in a net profit position Q1 instead of loss, which is impressive for a start-up.

&amp;#x200B;

**So if everything sounds so great why is the stock price 50% down from Dec/Jan highs?** Well, there’s a couple of reason why.

&amp;#x200B;

* Money flowing out of Growth stocks and SPACS
* Manipulation from short sellers (Very high SI)
* Hindenburg short report, down below is a further explanation to this report.

&amp;#x200B;

The short report by Hindenburg covers some issues regarding a DOJ investigation and points out the losses over the year. There’s some more minor stuff besides this.

The DOJ investigation looks to have been sorted out, they will probably announce something regarding this in the upcoming ER. The losses Hindenburg is pointing out are to be expected for a newly started company, and in my eyes, this is nothing to worry about as the company states they will be profitable in the fiscal year 2023. In fact, they already cut losses in half from 2019 to 2020, while generating 46% more revenue, impressive.

&amp;#x200B;

**After the short report by Hindenburg short-sellers beat the crap out of CLOV**

&amp;#x200B;

* CLOV responded to this in a long report, and the CEO Vivek Garipall went on a phone call with Forbes saying:

&amp;#x200B;

*“There is no more real person than I am about this shit,” he contended, casting himself as an honest broker in a “fucked up” healthcare market during a meandering phone call. “And I don’t care, like, publish whatever. But don’t publish stuff without people like us being able to comment and tell you what we think.”*

&amp;#x200B;

* This is a CEO that would do anything for his company, his shares are even locked up until the price reaches $30 for a period of 90 days!

**Next week,** when they release short interest info from NASDAQ (Tues AH), May MA enrollments and earnings (May 17, PM), and options expiry date on May 21… can you feel something big and positive will come in the next few weeks? I sure as hell can!

&amp;#x200B;

**Macro-wise,** NASDAQ had a little correction this week (today’s job report sort of kicked rotation from value to growth). Also, hopefully, after Elon’s SNL this weekend, that crypt-o capital will gradually flow into the stock market, especially already beat-up small/medium growth stocks with WSB “short &amp; gamma squeeze” candidate).

&amp;#x200B;

**Bearish case:**

* Increasing competition in the space
* Legacy companies VS CLOV
* From 46% YoY growth to \~24% guidance growth for 2021 (however this is really early still, we would need q1 to see updates on this, may surprise?)
* Potential Nasdaq correction

&amp;#x200B;

**Bonus info:** Alphabet (Google) backed CLOV with a $500m investment. Walmart and CLOV recently made a partnership. Demetrios Kouzoukas joins BOD.

&amp;#x200B;

**Analyst ratings:**

* Citigroup buy with a PT of $19
* Credit Suisse neutral with a PT of $10
* JP Morgan neutral with a PT of $15

So right now we are trading below all analyst ratings.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** CLOV is currently below its NAV and even further away from the average PT set by analysts.This is a company with huge success and a bright future ahead of it, in one of the hottest sectors under the Democrats! The potential downside is very low, as we are already near the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

   * Vertical Bull Debit Call Spread - Buy a ATM call, sell OTM calls. (Low/medium risk)

**My price predictions**. If we get a little gamma squeeze I see this go to around $40-60 If we get a full-blown gamma squeeze combined with a short squeeze I could see this go to $75+ Without a gamma squeeze I see this at $15-30 before May 21st. **Please do your own DD before investing**, I’m not a financial adviser.

**\*TL;DR at the bottom**

So first let me get some things straight. I’m not saying this could become another GME, but if it reaches even 10% of the GME potential then we might have a really good play here.

&amp;#x200B;

**Chamath** is one of the big investors in this stock. CLOV was made public through one of his SPAC’S. I know lots of apes hate him, sure he should have diamond-handed GME. But should that be the reason not to buy CLOV? His track record is incredible nonetheless!

* A little more about the investment Chamath made! Short-term-wise, he can’t pull out his investment as he did with $SPCE because his lock-up expires in July 2021. I have to say that he wouldn’t jeopardize his reputations if he thought Clover was a scam and didn’t see the potentials.

**Vivek Garipalli** is the co-founder and CEO of Clover Health. Prior to founding CLOV, he founded CarePoint Health in 2008, a fully integrated healthcare system in New Jersey. He owns 83.5m shares in CLOV which is classified as class B shares which is looked until the price reached $30$ for a period of 90 consecutive days. In his early days he worked as an Healthcare Investment Banker at Credit Suisse, he also has worked at Blackstone Group and JPMorgan Partners.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Clover Health?** Well, it’s an insurance company providing cheaper solutions for customers, but with a focus on the individual. In their own words: “Clover’s Medicare Advantage plans are built on technology from the ground-up. Integrating our systems with doctors, clinicians, and nurse practitioners, Clover’s data team helps healthcare professionals in the field intervene directly into patients’ wellness to help them avoid acute health episodes.”

&amp;#x200B;

* The development of this software is led by the Andrew Toy the President and Chief Technology Officer at CLOV and a former Product Director from Google, working with things such as Develop Platforms, Develop Ecosystems and AI/Machine Intelligence.

&amp;#x200B;

* What’s the difference between Clover health and Original Medicare? Original Medicare covers some of the costs of hospitals and doctor visits but does not cover prescription drugs or vision, dental, or hearing care. It can have high copays and coinsurance, which can lead to high costs if a beneficiary needs to go to the hospital. Clover’s Medicare Advantage PPO plan covers hospitals and doctor visits like Original Medicare, as well as prescription coverage and additional benefits aimed at keeping members healthy – all at a low cost and on an open network.

&amp;#x200B;

* Besides being an insurance company, CLOV also seeks to develop the industry’s best, most well-informed, and useful physician assistant tool to empower its partners to deliver better primary care to Clover members. They focus on PCPs because they are the trusted quarterback of each member’s care that have the most significant impact on their care journeys. Arming them with relevant patient information and data-driven insights empowers them to take better care of Clover’s members.

**Now to the fun part, the numbers!**

**Public Float:** 109M; The biggest 3 combined owns 33M shares (Vanguard 26.1M, Black Rock – 2M, Baillie Gifford &amp; Co– 5M: They are either mutual fund &amp; long-term, so it is highly unlikely they will sell in short term. This also makes it way harder for short sellers to fully cover their short positions as they would need a lot of shares which is locked up in these mutual funds.

&amp;#x200B;

**Revenue:** In 2020 they made $672.9m with a net loss of $92.7m and $462.3m in 2019 with a net loss of $181.5m. Revenue grew 46% from 2019 to 2020! Guidance for 2021 is $820-850m that’s a YoY growth of \~24.1%. They expect to be fully profitable in 2023, pretty impressive! Compared to the average 8-9% growth YoY in the medical insurance sector CLOV is doing way better!

&amp;#x200B;

**EBITDA** may not be sexy, but they can easily beat EPS for sure. They will flush $44.8M gain on derivatives in Q1 (officially published), which can shoot up net income. Also, they flushed all the unnecessary expenses/losses in Q4 (i.e. IPOC and CLOV Merger legal costs, etc…. In Q1, 2020, they had a loss of 28M. So this one-time boost on derivatives in Q1 will beat the EPS estimate (at least for Q1). Also, they said they will increase their guidance - per the linked publication.

&amp;#x200B;

**Option Interest on Calls:** 601,034 (multiply by 100, which is 60M) - Gamma Squeeze. (Total) 350k of those expire in May. The options table looks ideal for a potential gamma squeeze, have a look in the picture below. As you can see there’s lots of open interest for almost every strike! Short sellers and the total call OI is around 107m shares if all calls become ITM. This would literally make it impossible for naked call sellers and short sellers to cover their position because of the low public float of 109m shares!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Short interest:** As of Friday the SI% of the float was 43.48% or 47m shares sold short. (source: S3 partners) This is quite a lot, actually the top 3 most shorted US stocks! The funny thing about this is that the price went up close to 5% even though shorties added another 2m shares to their short position. The SI% of float has gone up almost every day to keep the price down! However, HF’s are digging their own graves by doing that!

https://preview.redd.it/c0uufdbpz3y61.png?width=1124&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed099b217a8713c3d3c6adb6351581f5c8d308d5

&amp;#x200B;

📷

**Total call OI and shorted shares** are almost the same as the entire public float. Keep in mind that out of the public float of 109m, around 33m of those is locked up within the top 3 biggest investors. Bringing the actual free float down to 76m shares. This would make it nearly impossible for the short sellers to cover the 47.7m shares they shorted.

https://preview.redd.it/c2485b1oz3y61.png?width=608&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8234065b46987b06a4394d29b8856c929d1eaabd

&amp;#x200B;

**Short-Term Q1 Earning Call (Positive Catalyst - Facts)** \- 58,040 enrollment as of Dec 2020 increased to 66,395 enrollment as of April 2021 (they released earlier in April). So far, this increased 14% compared to the prior year (i.e. their revenue is also expected to increase by 14% from $166M in Dec to $189M in Mar 2021. Note that their annual guidance is 68K – 70K, so we are already halfway there meeting the target, excluding the CMS contract in 10 states (that opens the door up to 200,000, which was already approved and started on April 1) There was an email from Andrew (IR guy), he said that he will release at the right time (Quiet period until ER, so I would assume this will be released on ER. If not, when is Andrew ever going to release this positive news officially.

&amp;#x200B;

\- As of today there are 117 open job positions on Clover Health's website! Definitely a sign of growth

\- Lowering the age of Medicare to 60 from 65 would add another 23m Americans to the TAM. In money that equals around $250b more! This would definitely help CLOV expand further.

&amp;#x200B;

* In 2021, the Government would open the MA enrollment period for the whole year, so you can expect more people to enroll throughout 2021. - April 1, 2021 – Clover issued an 8-K statement to correct loss on derivative from $(51.1) million to $(6.3) million. This is a one-time adjustment that occurred after Dec 31, so this will get flushed as an adjustment in Q1. This is material because considering their budgeted M-C-R of 92.6%, Q1 profit is expected to be $13M (based on high-level calculations). This adjustment is 4 times that of profit/loss, so it will boost profits substantially in Q1 and the outlook of YTD 2021. (Note – if you are a long-term investor, you shouldn’t care too much about this because this is just paper profit. But, because analysts’ price target is based on the bottom line DCF, this will substantially boost their price target, further increase the price target). So, in Q1, Clover Health is expected to be in a net profit position Q1 instead of loss, which is impressive for a start-up.

&amp;#x200B;

**So if everything sounds so great why is the stock price 50% down from Dec/Jan highs?** Well, there’s a couple of reason why.

* Money flowing out of Growth stocks and SPACS
* Manipulation from short sellers (Very high SI)
* Hindenburg short report, down below is a further explanation to this report.

The short report by Hindenburg covers some issues regarding a DOJ investigation and points out the losses over the year. There’s some more minor stuff besides this.

The DOJ investigation looks to have been sorted out, they will probably announce something regarding this in the upcoming ER. The losses Hindenburg is pointing out are to be expected for a newly started company, and in my eyes, this is nothing to worry about as the company states they will be profitable in the fiscal year 2023. In fact, they already cut losses in half from 2019 to 2020, while generating 46% more revenue, impressive.

&amp;#x200B;

**After the short report by Hindenburg short-sellers beat the crap out of CLOV**

* CLOV responded to this in a long report, and the CEO Vivek Garipall went on a phone call with Forbes saying:

*“There is no more real person than I am about this shit,” he contended, casting himself as an honest broker in a “fucked up” healthcare market during a meandering phone call. “And I don’t care, like, publish whatever. But don’t publish stuff without people like us being able to comment and tell you what we think.”*

* This is a CEO that would do anything for his company, his shares are even locked up until the price reaches $30 for a period of 90 days!

**Next week,** when they release short interest info from NASDAQ (Tues AH), May MA enrollments and earnings (May 17, PM), and options expiry date on May 21… can you feel something big and positive will come in the next few weeks? I sure as hell can!

**Macro-wise,** NASDAQ had a little correction this week (today’s job report sort of kicked rotation from value to growth). Also, hopefully, after Elon’s SNL this weekend, that crypt-o capital will gradually flow into the stock market, especially already beat-up small/medium growth stocks with WSB “short &amp; gamma squeeze” candidate).

&amp;#x200B;

**Bearish case:**

* Increasing competition in the space
* Legacy companies VS CLOV
* From 46% YoY growth to \~24% guidance growth for 2021 (however this is really early still, we would need q1 to see updates on this, may surprise?)
* Potential Nasdaq correction

&amp;#x200B;

**Bonus info:** Alphabet (Google) backed CLOV with a $500m investment. Walmart and CLOV recently made a partnership. Demetrios Kouzoukas joins BOD.

&amp;#x200B;

**Analyst ratings:**

* Citigroup buy with a PT of $19
* Credit Suisse neutral with a PT of $10
* JP Morgan neutral with a PT of $15

So right now we are trading below all analyst ratings.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** CLOV is currently below its NAV and even further away from the average PT set by analysts.This is a company with huge success and a bright future ahead of it, in one of the hottest sectors under the Democrats! The potential downside is very low, as we are already near the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ways to get in**

&amp;#x200B;

* Bullgang  

   * Buy shares (Low risk)
   * Buy calls (Medium/high risk)
   * Vertical Bull Debit Call Spread - Buy a ATM call, sell OTM calls. (Low/medium risk)  

      * Example: Buy 1x $10 call at $0.40 (May 21, 2021), Sell 1x $12.5 call at $0.20 (May 21, 2021) 1 contract = 100 shares. Therefore, the maxium risk is $20 for each contract, and max potential gain is $230.

&amp;#x200B;

* Thetagang  

   * Sell cash-secured puts (Low risk)
   * Buy shares sell CC's (Low risk)

&amp;#x200B;

**My price predictions**. If we get a little gamma squeeze I see this go to around $40-60 If we get a full-blown gamma squeeze combined with a short squeeze I could see this go to $75+ Without a gamma squeeze I see this at $15-30 before May 21st. **Please do your own DD before investing**, I’m not a financial adviser. And this is not financial advice. I just would like a Lambo and quit my job

For the apes out there 🚀🚀🚀

**Position:** 81x $11 calls expiring in June, 3x $10 calls expiring in May and 10x $15 calls expiring in May.",Next level DD: CLOV,1,1,"Next level DD: CLOV &amp;#x200B;

If not, when is Andrew ever going to release this positive news officially.

&amp;#x200B;

\- As of today there are 117 open job positions on Clover Health's website! Definitely a sign of growth

\- Lowering the age of Medicare to 60 from 65 would add another 23m Americans to the TAM. In money that equals around $250b more! This would definitely help CLOV expand further.

&amp;#x200B;

* In 2021, the Government would open the MA enrollment period for the whole year, so you can expect more people to enroll throughout 2021. - April 1, 2021 – Clover issued an 8-K statement to correct loss on derivative from $(51.1) million to $(6.3) million. This is a one-time adjustment that occurred after Dec 31, so this will get flushed as an adjustment in Q1. This is material because considering their budgeted M-C-R of 92.6%, Q1 profit is expected to be $13M (based on high-level calculations). This adjustment is 4 times that of profit/loss, so it will boost profits substantially in Q1 and the outlook of YTD 2021. (Note – if you are a long-term investor, you shouldn’t care too much about this because this is just paper profit. But, because analysts’ price target is based on the bottom line DCF, this will substantially boost their price target, further increase the price target). So, in Q1, Clover Health is expected to be in a net profit position Q1 instead of loss, which is impressive for a start-up.

&amp;#x200B;

**So if everything sounds so great why is the stock price 50% down from Dec/Jan highs?** Well, there’s a couple of reason why.

* Money flowing out of Growth stocks and SPACS
* Manipulation from short sellers (Very high SI)
* Hindenburg short report, down below is a further explanation to this report.

The short report by Hindenburg covers some issues regarding a DOJ investigation and points out the losses over the year. There’s some more minor stuff besides this.

The DOJ investigation looks to have been sorted out, they will probably announce something regarding this in the upcoming ER. The losses Hindenburg is pointing out are to be expected for a newly started company, and in my eyes, this is nothing to worry about as the company states they will be profitable in the fiscal year 2023. In fact, they already cut losses in half from 2019 to 2020, while generating 46% more revenue, impressive.

&amp;#x200B;

**After the short report by Hindenburg short-sellers beat the crap out of CLOV**

* CLOV responded to this in a long report, and the CEO Vivek Garipall went on a phone call with Forbes saying:

*“There is no more real person than I am about this shit,” he contended, casting himself as an honest broker in a “fucked up” healthcare market during a meandering phone call. “And I don’t care, like, publish whatever. But don’t publish stuff without people like us being able to comment and tell you what we think.”*

* This is a CEO that would do anything for his company, his shares are even locked up until the price reaches $30 for a period of 90 days!

**Next week,** when they release short interest info from NASDAQ (Tues AH), May MA enrollments and earnings (May 17, PM), and options expiry date on May 21… can you feel something big and positive will come in the next few weeks? I sure as hell can!

**Macro-wise,** NASDAQ had a little correction this week (today’s job report sort of kicked rotation from value to growth). Also, hopefully, after Elon’s SNL this weekend, that crypt-o capital will gradually flow into the stock market, especially already beat-up small/medium growth stocks with WSB “short &amp; gamma squeeze” candidate).

&amp;#x200B;

**Bearish case:**

* Increasing competition in the space
* Legacy companies VS CLOV
* From 46% YoY growth to \~24% guidance growth for 2021 (however this is really early still, we would need q1 to see updates on this, may surprise?)
* Potential Nasdaq correction

&amp;#x200B;

**Bonus info:** Alphabet (Google) backed CLOV with a $500m investment. Walmart and CLOV recently made a partnership. Demetrios Kouzoukas joins BOD.

&amp;#x200B;

**Analyst ratings:**

* Citigroup buy with a PT of $19
* Credit Suisse neutral with a PT of $10
* JP Morgan neutral with a PT of $15

So right now we are trading below all analyst ratings.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** CLOV is currently below its NAV and even further away from the average PT set by analysts.This is a company with huge success and a bright future ahead of it, in one of the hottest sectors under the Democrats! The potential downside is very low, as we are already near the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ways to get in**

&amp;#x200B;

* Bullgang  

   * Buy shares (Low risk)
   * Buy calls (Medium/high risk)
   * Vertical Bull Debit Call Spread - Buy a ATM call, sell OTM calls. (Low/medium risk)  

      * Example: Buy 1x $10 call at $0.40 (May 21, 2021), Sell 1x $12.5 call at $0.20 (May 21, 2021) 1 contract = 100 shares. Therefore, the maxium risk is $20 for each contract, and max potential gain is $230.

&amp;#x200B;

* Thetagang  

   * Sell cash-secured puts (Low risk)
   * Buy shares sell CC's (Low risk)

&amp;#x200B;

**My price predictions**. If we get a little gamma squeeze I see this go to around $40-60 If we get a full-blown gamma squeeze combined with a short squeeze I could see this go to $75+ Without a gamma squeeze I see this at $15-30 before May 21st. **Please do your own DD before investing**, I’m not a financial adviser. And this is not financial advice. I just would like a Lambo and quit my job

So first let me get some things straight. I’m not saying this could become another GME, but if it reaches even 10% of the GME potential then we might have a really good play here.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Chamath** is one of the big investors in this stock. CLOV was made public through one of his SPAC’S. I know lots of apes hate him, sure he should have diamond-handed GME. But should that be the reason not to buy CLOV? His track record is incredible nonetheless!   

* A little more about the investment Chamath made! Short-term-wise, he can’t pull out his investment as he did with $SPCE because his lock-up expires in July 2021. I have to say that he wouldn’t jeopardize his reputations if he thought Clover was a scam and didn’t see the potentials.  

**Vivek Garipalli** is the co-founder and CEO of Clover Health. Prior to founding CLOV, he founded CarePoint Health in 2008, a fully integrated healthcare system in New Jersey. He owns 83.5m shares in CLOV which is classified as class B shares which is looked until the price reached $30$ for a period of 90 consecutive days. In his early days he worked as an Healthcare Investment Banker at Credit Suisse, he also has worked at Blackstone Group and JPMorgan Partners.   


**What is Clover Health?** Well, it’s an insurance company providing cheaper solutions for customers, but with a focus on the individual. In their own words: “Clover’s Medicare Advantage plans are built on technology from the ground-up. Integrating our systems with doctors, clinicians, and nurse practitioners, Clover’s data team helps healthcare professionals in the field intervene directly into patients’ wellness to help them avoid acute health episodes.”  

* The development of this software is led by the Andrew Toy the President and Chief Technology Officer at CLOV and a former Product Director from Google, working with things such as Develop Platforms, Develop Ecosystems and AI/Machine Intelligence. 

&amp;#x200B;

* What’s the difference between Clover health and Original Medicare? Original Medicare covers some of the costs of hospitals and doctor visits but does not cover prescription drugs or vision, dental, or hearing care. It can have high copays and coinsurance, which can lead to high costs if a beneficiary needs to go to the hospital. Clover’s Medicare Advantage PPO plan covers hospitals and doctor visits like Original Medicare, as well as prescription coverage and additional benefits aimed at keeping members healthy – all at a low cost and on an open network.  

&amp;#x200B;

* Besides being an insurance company, CLOV also seeks to develop the industry’s best, most well-informed, and useful physician assistant tool to empower its partners to deliver better primary care to Clover members. They focus on PCPs because they are the trusted quarterback of each member’s care that have the most significant impact on their care journeys. Arming them with relevant patient information and data-driven insights empowers them to take better care of Clover’s members.

**Public Float:** 109M; The biggest 3 combined owns 33M shares (Vanguard 26.1M, Black Rock – 2M, Baillie Gifford &amp; Co– 5M: They are either mutual fund &amp; long-term, so it is highly unlikely they will sell in short term. This also makes it way harder for short sellers to fully cover their short positions as they would need a lot of shares which is locked up in these mutual funds.   

&amp;#x200B;

**Revenue:** In 2020 they made $672.9m with a net loss of $92.7m and $462.3m in 2019 with a net loss of $181.5m. Revenue grew 46% from 2019 to 2020! Guidance for 2021 is $820-850m that’s a YoY growth of \~24.1%. They expect to be fully profitable in 2023, pretty impressive! Compared to the average 8-9% growth YoY in the medical insurance sector CLOV is doing way better!   

&amp;#x200B;

**EBITDA** may not be sexy, but they can easily beat EPS for sure. They will flush $44.8M gain on derivatives in Q1 (officially published), which can shoot up net income. Also, they flushed all the unnecessary expenses/losses in Q4 (i.e. IPOC and CLOV Merger legal costs, etc…. In Q1, 2020, they had a loss of 28M. So this one-time boost on derivatives in Q1 will beat the EPS estimate (at least for Q1). Also, they said they will increase their guidance - per the linked publication.

&amp;#x200B;

**Option Interest on Calls:** 601,034 (multiply by 100, which is 60M) - Gamma Squeeze. (Total) 350k of those expire in May. The options table looks ideal for a potential gamma squeeze, have a look in the picture below. As you can see there’s lots of open interest for almost every strike! Short sellers and the total call OI is around 107m shares if all calls become ITM. This would literally make it impossible for naked call sellers and short sellers to cover their position because of the low public float of 109m shares!   

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Short interest:** As of Friday the SI% of the float was 43.48% or 47m shares sold short. (source: S3 partners) This is quite a lot, actually the top 3 most shorted US stocks! The funny thing about this is that the price went up close to 5% even though shorties added another 2m shares to their short position. The SI% of float has gone up almost every day to keep the price down! However, HF’s are digging their own graves by doing that!   

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Total call OI and shorted shares** is almost the same as the entire public float. Keep in mind that out of the public float of 109m, around 33m of those is locked up within the top 3 biggest investors. Bringing the actual free float down to 76m shares. This would make it nearly impossible for the short sellers to cover the 47.7m shares they shorted.

&amp;#x200B;

**Short-Term Q1 Earning Call (Positive Catalyst - Facts)** \- 58,040 enrollment as of Dec 2020 increased to 66,395 enrollment as of April 2021 (they released earlier in April). So far, this increased 14% compared to the prior year (i.e. their revenue is also expected to increase by 14% from $166M in Dec to $189M in Mar 2021. Note that their annual guidance is 68K – 70K, so we are already halfway there meeting the target, excluding the CMS contract in 10 states (that opens the door up to 200,000, which was already approved and started on April 1) There was an email from Andrew (IR guy), he said that he will release at the right time (Quiet period until ER, so I would assume this will be released on ER. If not, when is Andrew ever going to release this positive news officially.

&amp;#x200B;

\- As of today there are 117 open job positions on Clover Health's website! Definitely a sign of growth

\- Lowering the age of Medicare to 60  from 65 would add another 23m Americans to the TAM. In money that equals around $250b more! This would definitely help CLOV expand further.  

&amp;#x200B;

* In 2021, the Government would open the MA enrollment period for the whole year, so you can expect more people to enroll throughout 2021. - April 1, 2021 – Clover issued an 8-K statement to correct loss on derivative from $(51.1) million to $(6.3) million. This is a one-time adjustment that occurred after Dec 31, so this will get flushed as an adjustment in Q1. This is material because considering their budgeted MCR of 92.6%, Q1 profit is expected to be $13M (based on high-level calculations). This adjustment is 4 times that of profit/loss, so it will boost profits substantially in Q1 and the outlook of YTD 2021. (Note – if you are a long-term investor, you shouldn’t care too much about this because this is just paper profit. But, because analysts’ price target is based on the bottom line DCF, this will substantially boost their price target, further increase the price target). So, in Q1, Clover Health is expected to be in a net profit position Q1 instead of loss, which is impressive for a start-up.   

&amp;#x200B;

**So if everything sounds so great why is the stock price 50% down from Dec/Jan highs?** Well, there’s a couple of reason why.  

* Money flowing out of Growth stocks and SPACS 
* Manipulation from short sellers (Very high SI)  
* Hindenburg short report, down below is a further explanation to this report.  

The short report by Hindenburg covers some issues regarding a DOJ investigation and points out the losses over the year. There’s some more minor stuff besides this.   

The DOJ investigation looks to have been sorted out, they will probably announce something regarding this in the upcoming ER. The losses Hindenburg is pointing out are to be expected for a newly started company, and in my eyes, this is nothing to worry about as the company states they will be profitable in the fiscal year 2023. In fact, they already cut losses in half from 2019 to 2020, while generating 46% more revenue, impressive.   

&amp;#x200B;

**After the short report by Hindenburg short-sellers beat the crap out of CLOV**  

* CLOV responded to this in a long report, and the CEO Vivek Garipall went on a phone call with Forbes saying:  

 *“There is no more real person than I am about this shit,” he contended, casting himself as an honest broker in a “fucked up” healthcare market during a meandering phone call. “And I don’t care, like, publish whatever. But don’t publish stuff without people like us being able to comment and tell you what we think.”*  

* This is a CEO that would do anything for his company, his shares are even locked up until the price reaches $30 for a period of 90 days!    

&amp;#x200B;

**Next week,** when they release short interest info from NASDAQ (Tues AH), May MA enrollments and earnings (May 17, PM), and options expiry date on May 21… can you feel something big and positive will come in the next few weeks? I sure as hell can!  

&amp;#x200B;

**Macro-wise,** NASDAQ had a little correction this week (today’s job report sort of kicked rotation from value to growth). Also, hopefully, after Elon’s SNL this weekend, that crypt-o capital will gradually flow into the stock market, especially already beat-up small/medium growth stocks with WSB “short &amp; gamma squeeze” candidate).  

&amp;#x200B;

**Bearish case:**  

* Increasing competition in the space 
* Legacy companies VS CLOV 
* From 46% YoY growth to \~24% guidance growth for 2021 (however this is really early still, we would need q1 to see updates on this, may surprise?) 
* Potential Nasdaq correction    

&amp;#x200B;

**Bonus info:** Alphabet (Google) backed CLOV with a $500m investment. Walmart and CLOV recently made a partnership. Demetrios Kouzoukas joins BOD.    

**Analyst ratings:**  

* Citigroup buy with a PT of $19  
* Credit Suisse neutral with a PT of $10 
* JP Morgan neutral with a PT of $15 

 So right now we are trading below all analyst ratings.   

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** CLOV is currently below its NAV and even further away from the average PT set by analysts.This is a company with huge success and a bright future ahead of it, in one of the hottest sectors under the Democrats!   The potential downside is very low, as we are already near the bottom.   

**Ways to get in** 

* Bullgang
   * Buy shares (Low risk)
   * Buy calls (Medium/high risk) 
   * Vertical Bull Debit Call Spread - Buy a ATM call, sell OTM calls. (Low/medium risk)
      * Example: Buy 1x $10 call at $0.40 (May 21, 2021), Sell 1x $12.5 call at $0.20 (May 21, 2021) 1 contract = 100 shares. Therefore, the maxium risk is $20 for each contract, and max potential gain is $230. 
* Thetagang
   * Sell cash secured puts (Low risk) 
   * Buy shares sell CC's (Low risk)

**My price predictions**.  If we get a little gamma squeeze I see this go to around $40-60  If we get a full-blown gamma squeeze combined with a short squeeze I could see this go to $75+   Without a gamma squeeze I see this at $15-30 before May 21st. **Please do your own DD before investing**, I’m not a financial adviser. And this is not financial advice. I just would like a Lambo and quit my job  

For the apes out there 🚀🚀🚀

**Position:** 81x $11 calls expiring in June, 3x $10 calls expiring in May and 10x $15 calls expiring in May.",Next level DD: CLOV,1,1,"Next level DD: CLOV **\*TL;DR at the bottom**  

So first let me get some things straight. I’m not saying this could become another GME, but if it reaches even 10% of the GME potential then we might have a really good play here.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Chamath** is one of the big investors in this stock. CLOV was made public through one of his SPAC’S. I know lots of apes hate him, sure he should have diamond-handed GME. But should that be the reason not to buy CLOV? His track record is incredible nonetheless!   

* A little more about the investment Chamath made! Short-term-wise, he can’t pull out his investment as he did with $SPCE because his lock-up expires in July 2021. I have to say that he wouldn’t jeopardize his reputations if he thought Clover was a scam and didn’t see the potentials.  

**Vivek Garipalli** is the co-founder and CEO of Clover Health. Prior to founding CLOV, he founded CarePoint Health in 2008, a fully integrated healthcare system in New Jersey. He owns 83.5m shares in CLOV which is classified as class B shares which is looked until the price reached $30$ for a period of 90 consecutive days. In his early days he worked as an Healthcare Investment Banker at Credit Suisse, he also has worked at Blackstone Group and JPMorgan Partners.   


**What is Clover Health?** Well, it’s an insurance company providing cheaper solutions for customers, but with a focus on the individual. In their own words: “Clover’s Medicare Advantage plans are built on technology from the ground-up. Integrating our systems with doctors, clinicians, and nurse practitioners, Clover’s data team helps healthcare professionals in the field intervene directly into patients’ wellness to help them avoid acute health episodes.”  

* The development of this software is led by the Andrew Toy the President and Chief Technology Officer at CLOV and a former Product Director from Google, working with things such as Develop Platforms, Develop Ecosystems and AI/Machine Intelligence. 

&amp;#x200B;

* What’s the difference between Clover health and Original Medicare? Original Medicare covers some of the costs of hospitals and doctor visits but does not cover prescription drugs or vision, dental, or hearing care. It can have high copays and coinsurance, which can lead to high costs if a beneficiary needs to go to the hospital. Clover’s Medicare Advantage PPO plan covers hospitals and doctor visits like Original Medicare, as well as prescription coverage and additional benefits aimed at keeping members healthy – all at a low cost and on an open network.  

&amp;#x200B;

* Besides being an insurance company, CLOV also seeks to develop the industry’s best, most well-informed, and useful physician assistant tool to empower its partners to deliver better primary care to Clover members. They focus on PCPs because they are the trusted quarterback of each member’s care that have the most significant impact on their care journeys. Arming them with relevant patient information and data-driven insights empowers them to take better care of Clover’s members.

I want this to squeeze, I need this to squeeze but all the Technical Analysis and DD in the world won't make it happen.

I am pumped for the share recount on June 2nd but numbers won't be released until July 29th. And then what happens? all these new rules are cute but nobody is going to step in. I don't trust the SEC, The DTCC, The Fed, NONE of them.

All the hedgefunds buying in are not on our side, they will be lending these shares out to their bleeding rivals to pick up some % fee... These shares will then be shorted synthetically and infinitely.

Infinity is a crazy number that most people's brains (smooth or wrinkled) cannot wrap around. But look at the charts. NOBODY is selling yet the price goes down/ barely moves. We had a small victory on Friday but I have no doubt things will continue to stay between $9-11 in the weeks to come.

The only way us Apes win is by volume increasing and forcing margin calls. If you look at any short squeeze in history, it's based on volume causing the tea kettle to boil and explode.

The media is covering this, the internet sites are corrupt. WE KNOW all of this. The hedgies will continue to self-report fake numbers and manipulate EVERYTHING and take a small fine (relatively) in the end.

The planes flying are going to draw awareness. The tweets are going to get more people in (especially from famous people like Chance the Rapper). We need to tell more people to buy in, even 10 shares will help the cause.

Also, we need to go to the movies. Instead of buying 5 more shares, it will help more to spend that money on a date night so that Q2 earnings EXPLODE. Positive earnings will bring volume. GURANTEED. That is our victory. That's when we get our bananas

**1. The squeeze already happened, from 5 to 15**

Facts: most shorts were in a 7$ and therefore were slightly underwater at 9. Yes, we've had huge volume during Thursday and Friday and one may say that all shorts covered already. However, half the volume (about 50m) during those couple of days were new shorts (source: http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html). So if we even accept the premise that all 60m shorts covered we still have 50m shorted which is close to 100% float again. The reality is that there are probably quite a number of old bears still holding the line and who are heavily underwater.

This is what REAL short squeeze looks like: VW Oct 2008 The Great Squeeze

Also, look at shares available to short: https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME

**2. Gamestop has a dying business model and is not going to last long-term**

Well yes, but you're looking at what Gamestop was. They are actively trying to turn the company's course around right now with a help from Ryan Cohen who at the very least has an excellent experience in managing and growing retail business. In itself it might be a questionable bullish case, but the market has a GameStop bankruptcy priced-in at 7$ and a perspective of a turn-around is a massive deviation from that common sentiment.

About the long-term thing: go to fucking /r/investing for that. Nobody's telling that this company is going to be a beast in 20 years time. The main point is that they're not dying, possibly growing somewhat and have an enormous potential for a huge squeeze. The following year or two after the consoles release are going to be explosive as it has every time before, which is also enough time for management to come up with new ways for a company to live besides selling games and consoles.

My wild guesses: PC bangs, e-sports involvement, gaming stuff (I know they already are, but there is a lot of space to grow in that direction)

Michael Burry involvement is also a somewhat convincing argument.

**3. Strong balance sheets **

You are seriously telling me that a market cap of 700m$ is adequate for a company which generated 6.5b$ revenue in 2019, having 2.3b$ in assets and 700m$ with cash on hands? And a company during the new console season which historically drive the price up to the tits

**4. Physical sales are decreasing compared to digital **

Yes, in percentages. But you should also account for the overall growth of the gaming market, and an argument can be made that total numbers are not decreasing that much. Now excuse me on this one, I can't manage to find exact stats in numbers and not in percentages (I've seen it a while ago somewhere on this sub), so if anyone has it please post.

Summary: 

* Gamestop isn't going to go bankrupt anytime soon 

* It is being overshorted with the premise that it is going to be bankrupt 

* The company actively tries to change it's course, so we would have a lot of positive news incoming 

* Every tiny piece of positive news is being multiplied tenfold by the short-sellers being underwater 

* Shares are heavily underpriced on what GME has right now in cash and revenue, and we're not even talking about possible company's revival

I own a bunch of calls and am considering trimming positions a little to take some profits. I figured it would be good to consolidate together a bunch of the DD and points I've seen on this sub over the last month

I understand the short squeeze theory: right now \~106% of shares outstanding and more like \~150% of the public float is shorted.

For a short squeeze, you need one of these things to happen:

* A large shareholder rapidly buying shares and then saying they are not going to lend these shares out (see what happened with Porsche-Volkswagen in 2008)
* Merger &amp; acquisition rumors / speculation
* Change in long-term prospects of the business that fundamentally changes the thesis of everyone short
* Catalyst for capitulation of the shorts (i.e. they realize they are wrong / are losing too much money in the short-term and close out positions)

In the case of GME:

* Shorts have not started capitulating - the short interest chart above shows short interest as % of shares outstanding actually increasing over the past several months 
* The Microsoft news is a bit of non-news, but could also be a positive:
   * The partnership does not appear to have any meaningful economics for GME
   * However, the positive signaling is that why would Microsoft announce a long-term partnership with GME if they don't think it will be around for at least a couple more years
   * Longer-term, if the partnership is valuable for Microsoft, there could be more meaningful support / economics provided to GME
* Ryan Cohen (Chewy Co-Founder) has taken a big stake
   * Helps remove a large % of shares out of the public float
   * If he gets more involved, perhaps he has a vision for how to transform GME in a more digital videogame world - this would be a big catalyst
* Michael Burry still owned a large chunk as of 6/30/2020 - will be interesting to see what his holdings look like on the next report date
* Most importantly, the thesis of hedge funds that are short has not changed - the medium-term prospects of GME are bleak, especially after the initial wave of foot traffic from the console sales
   * Mall traffic is down - COVID only accelerated the decline of malls
   * GME's footprint of 5,500+ stores seems like its unsustainable in the long-run - question is can they trim the footprint fast enough to a smaller, more profitable footprint that they will be around in the long-run
* The short squeeze feels like it will be a battle of who has more conviction and a longer time horizon - the hedge funds who are short or the WSB traders who are long
   * I love all of you guys, but I don't have much faith in WSB having more conviction / longer investment horizon than hedge funds (and by longer I mean who is willing to hold their position for a year to see it play out)

I do agree with the members on this sub that you can make money trading GME in the short-term, potentially seeing a rally up - but this is probably not going to be a LT winner

if you don’t like rocket emojis, large price increases, or DD created by an idiot, keep scrolling. For everyone else, lets begin! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Recently I have been looking into the utilization rates of different stocks throughout their run-ups. For those of you who don’t know what the utilization rate is, “Utilization is defined as loaned shares divided by available shares in the securities lending market, expressed as a percentage.” If utilization is high or maxed out, at 100%, it means that pretty much all shares that are available to be loaned out at that current time are loaned out, presumably to be shorted. I will be using ORTEX to view this data, and they get roughly 2/3 of the securities lending data, so take the numbers with a grain of salt.

Utilization basically represents the demand to short a stock, the higher the percentage means higher demand, and this can be bearish for lots of stocks, although for MEME stocks, this has NOT been the case, in fact it has seemingly provided rocket fuel!

Ultimately, I have found that utilization has been an important indicator to tell if stocks have the ability for incredibly large price increases, and when those price increases are over. After analyzing these trends, I have reason to believe CLOV could, within the next couple months, have a large run-up. RELEASE THE ROCKETS 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Firstly, lets take a fundamental look into CLOV

[https://www.reddit.com/r/CLOV/comments/ofzwnx/clov\_fundamental\_analysis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CLOV/comments/ofzwnx/clov_fundamental_analysis/) (Author:  [u/anjuna-freak](https://www.reddit.com/user/anjuna-freak/))

I don't want to rewrite this \^ so go read that if you want to read up on CLOV's fundamentals (i know most of you don't get your tits jacked by fundamentals but that's okay neither do I) Lets continue

Now let’s look into the utilization rate of different stocks and how that has related to stock price in the past. These stocks also had high short interest, although I wanted to keep the graphs as simple as possible (for the apes)s

Firstly, let’s look at GameStop (GME),

**These graphs show utilization as a percentage (YELLOW), price candles (RED + GREEN), and volume (BLUE)**

[GameStop was at 100&amp;#37; utilization beginning on September 4th, 2020 at a price of $9.20. ](https://preview.redd.it/nf4q2ck06na71.png?width=1603&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38b2dc0be089e1613eaa79f61460b45fed6e0386)

[ we being to see volume pickup around Jan 12th for GME and the price increases to $20, then over the next couple weeks GME rockets to a high of $485! During all of this, the utilization stays at 100&amp;#37;. BUT one week later from that price high we see utilization drop to 69&amp;#37; and price drop over 50&amp;#37;. ](https://preview.redd.it/jmduti757na71.png?width=1546&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e57f88e5c643addcf6ac94afba2f15974b56559)

What trend do we see?  We see our peak price while utilization is high, and a 20-30% utilization drop following our peak. The drop in utilization is ultimately the indicator to tell us the run-up is done for now. The price throughout all of January was increasing heavily, but had no effect on utilization, this run-up only ended once utilization fell steeply. GME is a much simpler stock to look at because it was so heavily shorted that its utilization was much more stable at/above 100%. But, now lets take a look at AMC, we see a very similar situation.

[Utilization hits 100&amp;#37; in Mid April, price action remains fairly calm until May 24th, we see a volume pickup, and the run-up begins. The price increases from $12 to a high of $72 on June 2nd. We see utilization fall after June 2nd from 99-100&amp;#37; to roughly 79&amp;#37;. During this time the price falls.](https://preview.redd.it/7oosrk1y9na71.png?width=1588&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=789dac1fbc378006357127009d3d3903664ef0f7)

Once again, we see utilization being the indicator that our runup is over, despite some large red and green days during the run up, the utilization still stays solid, it is only when the utilization falls significantly (roughly 20-30%) that we have hit a price peak. Now lets take a look at AMC a couple months earlier in March, where it had another runup.

[March 5th, utilization hits 100&amp;#37;, AMC price increases roughly 50&amp;#37; in next two days. The utilization then falls, and price continues to rise for a week or two. This runup was small, although we see the same trend of utilization only decreasing with a strong price increase. We then see utilization return to 100&amp;#37; in late April leading up to the huge May24th -June2nd run-up. Keep in mind that in this example utilization falls but returns very quick, which to me says that another run-up is viable, and that is exactly what happened](https://preview.redd.it/7w8tgu8bcna71.png?width=858&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f2ff85e733c2a2d1d0f8f03add30664dd44681d)

Now lets take a look at SNDL, another stock with a very similar run-up...

[In January, SNDL has a utilization of 100&amp;#37; at a price of $0.50. From January 27th-February 11th the utilization stayed in the high 90's only coming down to 88&amp;#37; for a short period. During this same period the price went from $1.00 to $4.00. We see utilization fall on February 18th down to 58&amp;#37; and this is ultimately the end of the runup confirmed.](https://preview.redd.it/by9ealxvgna71.png?width=1592&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a5f8d74797e7d01c876335879e381bc6e5378ea)

I'm including SNDL's run-up because it shows the same trend. Utilization hits 100%, it stays at least above/around 90% until a huge price runup. Then shortly after the utilization drops significantly to roughly 50-70% and the run-up is over. Finally, lets take a look at SPCE

[In December 2020, SPCE hits 100&amp;#37; utilization, In late January volume picks up and a run-up begins. Price goes from $24-63$ while utilization sits at over 95&amp;#37;. Utilization then falls sharply down to 60&amp;#37; after hitting its run-up high of $63. Utilization in April goes from 60&amp;#37; back to high 90&amp;#37;'s and once again the price surges from $24 now to roughly $40.](https://preview.redd.it/z43lvjjnjna71.png?width=1585&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77dbae6670b0a295a016e2b345db1b28131c9e7b)

Of course SPCE has had some fundamental drivers as well, but its utilization-price trend stays consistent with all the other runups. 

**TLDR; Almost all large meme stock runups have begun with utilization at 100% and a large volume increase. Utilization appears to act inversely with price, meaning when utilization is at 100% usually it only drops with a rise in price.**

""SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR CLOV??""   🦍🦍🦍 

Well... lets take a look into the utilization for CLOV 🍀 

[CLOV hit 100&amp;#37; utilization on June 8th while it ran from $6 - $28, and after this runup the utilization has stayed at 100&amp;#37;, only dipping down to 93&amp;#37; on June 24th. ](https://preview.redd.it/tkxy3a6tnna71.png?width=2686&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0be1457b866d5d84386eb4bff7bc971d6b8b371d)

CLOV is currently waiting for a volume increase to start its BIG run-up. It had a smaller run-up about a month ago, although just look at the utilization, it barely dipped. If you go back and look at the other stocks I featured, specifically AMC in march, you will see that smaller run-ups will dip the utilization, although until it drops 20-30%, the true run-up is not done. I cannot tell you when the volume increase will come, although I can confidently say, that if people don't give up on CLOV, its going to the moon! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

 

[Also, who doesn't like seeing 35&amp;#37; short interest? To put this into perspective, AMC had a maximum of 19&amp;#37; short interest.](https://preview.redd.it/w6pb59xbuna71.png?width=139&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0de4f0b7a3e690710a10daa1a4cf0ee6df4aa4b)

In my opinion this high of a short interest isn't warranted based on CLOV's fundamentals, which you can go read about (ew, reading🦍) back at the top of this DD

**TLDR; CLOV is setup to explode with the next volume surge. Fundamentally it doesn't deserve to be so shorted. The same Utilization trends have been seen is most meme stocks. Utilization doesn't usually fall without price going up. Currently, CLOV has 100% utilization and 35% short interest. MOON SOON (next volume surge) 🚀 🍀 🚀 🍀 🚀 🍀 🚀 🍀 🚀 🍀 🚀**

We see utilization fall on February 18th down to 58&amp;#37; and this is ultimately the end of the runup confirmed.](https://preview.redd.it/by9ealxvgna71.png?width=1592&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a5f8d74797e7d01c876335879e381bc6e5378ea)

I'm including SNDL's run-up because it shows the same trend. Utilization hits 100%, it stays at least above/around 90% until a huge price runup. Then shortly after the utilization drops significantly to roughly 50-70% and the run-up is over. Finally, lets take a look at SPCE

[In December 2020, SPCE hits 100&amp;#37; utilization, In late January volume picks up and a run-up begins. Price goes from $24-63$ while utilization sits at over 95&amp;#37;. Utilization then falls sharply down to 60&amp;#37; after hitting its run-up high of $63. Utilization in April goes from 60&amp;#37; back to high 90&amp;#37;'s and once again the price surges from $24 now to roughly $40.](https://preview.redd.it/z43lvjjnjna71.png?width=1585&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77dbae6670b0a295a016e2b345db1b28131c9e7b)

Of course SPCE has had some fundamental drivers as well, but its utilization-price trend stays consistent with all the other runups. 

**TLDR; Almost all large meme stock runups have begun with utilization at 100% and a large volume increase. Utilization appears to act inversely with price, meaning when utilization is at 100% usually it only drops with a rise in price.**

""SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR CLOV??""   🦍🦍🦍 

Well... lets take a look into the utilization for CLOV 🍀 

[CLOV hit 100&amp;#37; utilization on June 8th while it ran from $6 - $28, and after this runup the utilization has stayed at 100&amp;#37;, only dipping down to 93&amp;#37; on June 24th. ](https://preview.redd.it/tkxy3a6tnna71.png?width=2686&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0be1457b866d5d84386eb4bff7bc971d6b8b371d)

CLOV is currently waiting for a volume increase to start its BIG run-up. It had a smaller run-up about a month ago, although just look at the utilization, it barely dipped. If you go back and look at the other stocks I featured, specifically AMC in march, you will see that smaller run-ups will dip the utilization, although until it drops 20-30%, the true run-up is not done. I cannot tell you when the volume increase will come, although I can confidently say, that if people don't give up on CLOV, its going to the moon! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

 

[Also, who doesn't like seeing 35&amp;#37; short interest? To put this into perspective, AMC had a maximum of 19&amp;#37; short interest.](https://preview.redd.it/w6pb59xbuna71.png?width=139&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0de4f0b7a3e690710a10daa1a4cf0ee6df4aa4b)

In my opinion this high of a short interest isn't warranted based on CLOV's fundamentals, which you can go read about (ew, reading🦍) back at the top of this DD

**TLDR; CLOV is setup to explode with the next volume surge. Fundamentally it doesn't deserve to be so shorted. The same Utilization trends have been seen is most meme stocks. Utilization doesn't usually fall without price going up. Currently, CLOV has 100% utilization and 35% short interest. MOON SOON (next volume surge) 🚀 🍀 🚀 🍀 🚀 🍀 🚀 🍀 🚀 🍀 🚀**

see utilization drop amp price drop amp What trend see We see peak price utilization high utilization drop following peak The drop utilization ultimately indicator tell u run done The price throughout

Utilization hit amp Mid April price action remains fairly calm May th see volume pickup run begin The price increase high June nd We see utilization fall June nd amp roughly amp During time price fall Once see utilization indicator runup despite large red green day run utilization still stay solid utilization fall significantly roughly hit price peak Now let take look AMC couple month earlier March another runup March th utilization hit amp AMC price increase roughly amp next two day The utilization fall price continues rise week two This runup small although see trend utilization decreasing

Do not be too discouraged by the people saying it is over and that this is now a far away dream for us to make this happen. It simply is not over, as long as everyone stays proactive in keeping this alive.

First things first, let’s hash out some rationale as to why, from a fundamental standpoint, we could currently still be in the game.

As we know corruption and manipulation took place last week and that was obvious, what isn’t so obvious is the speculation on the short interest and how the sentiment seems to have been shifted to say it has already been covered. Some think they covered at the top, this doesn’t make sense, if they covered at the top when they started restricting purchases since this would have drove the price up, not down so that really is not a valid option. From this standpoint we can assume they have not covered and why would we assume anything otherwise, they wouldn’t cover at those prices, they would wait to drive it into the ground to cover because they knew they had the resources to do so. If this is the case we are currently in the position of being driven down to scare retailers, lowering the price further so they can cover. It seems to be working and it should not be.

I do believe we are at this point, however a lot of money has been scared out of GME. This is not good, we also got divided by AMC and BB, this should not have happened either we are not a collective, but people should have saw the golden ticket that GME was (and still is, I will explain later). So we can ask ourselves assuming they haven’t covered what can we do? 

Those of us who are holding keep holding, those of you who are not holding can buy in with money you do not care to lose. If my theory is correct this is all we have to do is this and we win. You may ask yourself why we should do this, my answer is because they likely doubled down their shorts at the top if we break those prices this will be the biggest transfer of wealth of all time surely. This would mean over 200% of shares are shorted and thus this sub could essentially reach monetary Nirvana due to the fact none of us would be bag holders they would have to buy every share 2x. If people decide to go this route (USE A TRILLION DOLLAR FIRM LIKE FIDELITY OR SCHWAB)

For the sake of argument let’s assume they did cover however and the initial squeeze has past, but they doubled down. We can still make this work to our advantage. If they did cover then in their heads they won and certainly by price it looks that way. How do we use this situation to our benefit you ask? Easy, what we can do is let them think they won and place their shorts, don’t do anything until the stimulus arrives and those who don’t need the stimulus can put it into GME. You can run the math but if an 1/8 of the sub put their stimulus in we would have over 1.2 billion and we could garner much more from fomo. This could get the snowball rolling ALOT. If they doubled down and everyone is on a secure firm then the squeeze WILL happen and we can all prosper because of it. 

We need more momentum though and all it should really take is for you to think about this for 5 minutes what if we pulled this off, the greatest comeback in the history of comebacks and we all were a part of it. There would need to be parameters to pull this off perfectly. From my estimation the parameters to make this run smoothly are

Everyone only puts in what they are willing to lose, if done right this mitigates selling almost entirely.

Everyone uses a firm that will shutdown buying

You use the money you receive to do good things to shine a positive light on this movement.

If we can check all three of those then we cannot lose.

We cannot let the crooks keep us in indentured servitude so they can live on yachts. It’s time for a change, do it for your kids and grandkids, be someone who can say they helped build that force of unstoppable power to take out these criminals.

Retail trade volume has got to be low, GameStop continues to drive down and the SPX reaches new all time highs.  

This is why this GameStop trade will go down in history. It was a short squeeze opportunity that exploited the exploits of the stock market! And this is why I, like so many others, continue to hold.  The short squeeze for this stock is not over, and while Wall St. knows this, they are trying to minimize their future losses because, let’s be honest, who wouldn’t?

The more important thing that they must already realize, though, is that power in the markets IS shifting. More money entering the stock market= greater market dispersion=greater wealth dispersion=DONT BE SO DUMB AS YOU WERE BEFORE AND OVERLEVERAGE. 

What this means for the overall market, my outlook is bearish. 

What this means for GameStop, amc, and these other stocks in which retail volume is high; they will be the ones’ to prosper (albeit very luckily) because they were the ones’ that retail traders chose to make examples of.  Their short squeezes will come to fruition, and at the point, for those who can’t ALREADY TELL, it will be even more obvious that monetary power is spreading, and the wants and needs of people collectively will be what drives the future market 

This is my encouragement to all you diamond hands. Hold on.

GameStop and AMC have mirrored this rise, but at a far faster pace. After reaching multi-year highs last week, these stocks quickly gave up their gains as short-sellers and options traders adjusted their positions.
