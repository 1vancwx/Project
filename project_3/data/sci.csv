The article [The Safety of COVID-19 Vaccinations—We Should Rethink the Policy](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9070693) has [been retracted](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9070729) from *Vaccines* as of July 2, 2021. Concerns were raised regarding misinterpretation of data from a national vaccine adverse event reporting system that led to ""incorrect and distorted conclusions."" After the authors failed to respond satisfactorily to the claims raised by the Editor-in-Chief and Editorial Board, the article was retracted.

This capsule brings into the picture $PROG which is in partnership with at least a couple of pharm companies in the development of their ingestible device patent portfolio.

Payoneer vs PayPal

&gt;*Payoneer, the Paypal for Shithole Developing Countries*

Payoneer is Paypal for B2B global commerce, particularly outside North American and Europe. The company provides B2B services for millions of SMB and enterprises around the world

The growth of Payoneer’s global network included a move into India in April 2016, following a partnership with Pune-based IndusInd Bank and expressions of interest in its services from more than 10,000 freelancers and small businesses across the country.

2018 PayPal study suggest that India’s freelancers represent around one quarter of the world’s gig workforce.

**In August 2019, Payoneer announced a year-on-year increase of 400% in its customer base and a threefold increase in payment volumes processed in India.**

*“PayPal says to shut domestic payments business in India” \~ Reuters*

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - PayPal Holdings Inc will wind down its domestic payments business in India from April 1,2021 the company said in a statement on Friday.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hhza5041h2081.png?width=1743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68e6bf53ca2bac7703919dbfab86bacbc49c0e89

https://preview.redd.it/x0b8v621h2081.png?width=1759&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb18aeaaf2806e2c0123eff083901b6b53691b5b

The ideal customer is a small but growing SMB doing business all over the world which needs currency, compliance and business services. Payoneer is an obvious candidate to handles these needs given its global network.

· Payoneer offers vendors the ability to move money with a U.S. bank account and pay suppliers, without having to deal with too many banking hurdles or red tape.

· A lot of freelancers on Upwork.com use Payoneer because many of them live in countries that Upwork.com can't wire money to.

· Once vendors receive funds into their Payoneer account they can either withdraw the cash using their Payoneer provided Master Card or do a direct bank transfer from Payoneer to their local bank. Usually funds arrive within 1-2 business days.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/okzrve92h2081.png?width=1764&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c61bd06737a159941b6f9f26d96255fc497029c7

So, it is basically a bank that includes an accountant to help meet a business’ needs. The one product or feature that is missing is digital coins.

Say a consumer wants to rent an airbnb. They use a credit card (or other payment method) to pay airbnb, a payment gateway facilitates payment acceptance. The payment is then processed and Airbnb ends up with the money from the transaction. Airbnb has now gathered cash through its acquirers (e.g., Adyen, ACI). Airbnb now needs to distribute funds to its SMB sellers. Airbnb uses payoneer to disburse funds to sellers. From this example, you can see Payoneer isn't competing with companies like Adyen or other acquirers/ processors, even though they are processing payments.

Payoneer signs up individual sellers, which allows the sellers to use payoneer across platforms (e.g., facebook marketplace and amazon). Hyperwallet (owned by PayPal) is one of their competitors, but Hyperwallet operates completely differently, they sign up users via the platform, but this means you can't use hyperwallet for your business on both amazon and fb marketplace without going through the onboarding process again. Given the trend towards SMB sellers operating across multiple marketplaces, this is a huge benefit for payoneer, and makes PayPal's offering a lot less competitive. It also means Payoneer owns the seller relationship in a way that PayPal doesn't do as effectively, and makes it easier for them to package other offerings (e.g., working capital). These other offerings provide a two-fold benefit - their customer relationships become stronger, so revenue is seen as more recurring and investors will pay a higher multiple; and they'll make more money per customer.

My view is that Payoneer should see an S-type growth curve, where they'll hit a critical mass of users and see exponential growth, like cashapp, or venmo. Their investor presentation projects 25% revenue growth over the next couple years, I think this is super conservative, especially considering that 25% growth rate doesn't account for the two travel related marketplaces that got screwed by covid. Once they hit that critical mass of users, they'll pop off, sales &amp; marketing expenses will drop, and they'll become profitable.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h4bl85z2h2081.png?width=1556&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70d883ab62f7fb8a486f106a561fb6b927009211

The company’s focus on investing for future services is actually what gets me most excited as it may ward off near-term investor interest and improves its competitive position. It’s also a sign of a mature management team. The opportunity to provide additional services such as working capital, compliance and tax services seems like an obvious strategic move to drive growth. Specifically, working capital is far and away the most important service and something SMBs are desperate for.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r6mxf5e3h2081.png?width=1664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b56c5ccf853698f4f9ded9ecff758e2235e20180

Who are their customers and where are they know? 5 million businesses in 190 countries. Customers include Amazon, Wish, Lazada (owned by Alibaba) Shopee, and Ebay. Weird right, they work with Ebay given Paypal does too. This is because they work with countries and specific clients that Paypal not accept into their platform. Investors need to understand that sometimes people have to use other platforms because they the Paypal’s or banks are NOT willing to take the risk. Sure the risk is probably higher but the amount of people that need access to capital or payment process is high when many banks in many countries do not approve people for such type of access.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bt75qez3h2081.png?width=1631&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16c8e2fe383ce420e3c7a435f414ce4a74f599fd

B2B global marketplace. The attractiveness of FinTech can be summarized in a few words, namely, “scale” and “network effects”. From the metrics Payoneer shared, it looks like they’re benefitting from these dynamics. Analysts estimate the global B2B market at tens of trillions $ and cross-border payments at $300bn. Obviously the pandemic only accelerated these trends. (From the presentation, it looks like company B2B AR/AP volume more than doubled at 140% in 2020 although the CFO later cited a 53% increase in volumes so not sure exactly how to interpret that.)

Volume and customer growth drives revenues. Volumes grew over 53% in 2020 (67% adjusted for the pandemic) and are expected to grow at 44% and 33% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, which translates into 25% annual revenue growth per year for the next two years.

&amp;#x200B;

The benefits of network effects cannot be overstated as Paypal has proven. As a company acquires more customers, the value of its network increases. Payoneer’s business model leverages this same dynamic. Moreover, its network would be very difficult to replicate. The company’s global platform includes over 80 banks and clearing partners in over 100 countries. The company also provides customers data about its transactions, which I believe will be increasingly useful and sticky.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I think the future holds for Payoneer? I actually think there are several exits for this company.

**Growth:**

Note that Payoneer currently doesn’t do B2C, hence it may be quite common for retail to never even have heard of it, unless they are a business or in the gig economy. That is one of the problems for the stock, no one has heard of it (yet) because it works quietly behind the scenes. Given enough funding, who knows, Payoneer may well expand to B2C. Alibaba initially started as B2B as well but has since expanded to B2C (Taobao).

We just need Payoneer to be 5% of PayPal (ie. $15B market cap) in order for stock price to be in the $30-$40 range. ($6B market cap corresponds to around $13-$15 stock price.)

\*\*Acquisition:\*\*Large international payments processer buys them. Could be Paypal, Square, Stripe, First Data, etc. consolidation WILL happen in this space and I think short-term Payoneer will acquire some companies and then be sold to a bigger company. Think of this as how banks in the USA were allowed to merge in 1995 given the law that passed. Before you had 100,000 banks then it was 50,000 banks, then 10,000 banks and now like 5,000 banks but the top 10 banks make up a large % of the business/volume.

Wildcard: CRM business buys them. What many people do not realize is that CRM’s have been changing the game. First it was to help you sell with marketing tools, then it is to improve communication within the team, then it will be storage, and legal transactions then it will be financial transaction. They are literally going to control the beginning to the end of the customer relationship and all of that data they possess is very valuable to help their customers grow.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

* A sharp selloff in large technology companies dragged down stocks on Friday, capping off a week of wild swings in financial markets.
* Traders have had a lot to think about in the last few days, from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's hawkish stance to uncertainty about how the omicron coronavirus outbreak will affect global reopening.
* A mixed jobs report in the United States did nothing to avert another bout of intense volatility. The reason for this is that there is a widespread belief that the data will not be game-changers, with policymakers likely to accelerate the tapering of asset purchases in the face of elevated inflation.
* The stock market's weekly decline has been extended. Tesla fell about 6.5%, and Facebook parent Meta Platforms approached a bear market after a 19.7% drop from a recent peak. Apple fell after news broke that the phones of a number of US State Department employees had been hacked.
* China's companies listed in the United States fell amid plans by ride-hailing giant Didi Global to exit American exchanges and regulators' plans to force foreign firms to open their books or risk delisting.
* The US Treasury once again stopped from labeling any foreign economies as currency manipulators, while maintaining that Taiwan and Vietnam met all three criteria for the designation.

#### Commentary:

* Reclaiming 450 support on the false breakout to the downside was the only positive for the Bulls to another brutal week. 
* The 20 SMMA (450.77) has acted as a perfect dip buying opportunity (minus Sept.) throughout the year so it will be interesting to see how that plays out next week. 
* I believe that the Bulls will attempt a run to 459-460 resistance level (pending more FUD news about the new covid variant, taper talks, etc.) early next week. 
   * The first test will be the pivot at 455.67. Best case - they gap above the pivot level on Monday. 
* If Bulls establish support above 462 resistance (on monthly chart) the Christmas rally will be back on the menu and we may test 470 and ATH.
* If 459-460 holds and Bears clear the 455.67 pivot they shall see 450 again. This would make it a triple bottom from Dec. 1. 
   * I believe the third time will be the charm and they will finally breakthrough support (just too many macro headwinds IMO.)
* We have a pivotal week ahead of us!

#### Levels:

* Support area: 449.67 
* Pivot: 455.67
* Resistance - 460.04
* Bullish Targets: 463.39 - 466.98 - 469.68 - 471.21 - 473.78
* Bearish Targets: 446.88 - 443.43 - 439.88 - 436.39

Strategies:

* If Bullish - play to Resistance (460.04) and watch Pivot (455.67). Wait for Resistance break and successful Support test at 460 for more calls.  
* If Bearish - short at Pivot (455.67) or Resistance (460.04) and play to Support, keeping an eye on Pivot for reversal to upside. Wait for Support break and successful Resistance test  at 449.67 for more puts.

# Company Description

Groupon operates an online marketplace for deals on local goods, services, travel, and attractions. Revenue is driven by commissions from sellers, with 60% of gross sales coming from North America. The company also has substantial holdings in equity investments, with their SumUp (fintech) assets estimated at approx $500m alone (current GRPN mkt cap \~$640m). The company brought on the former Zappos CEO as a permanent CEO in 4Q21, replacing the interim CEO.

# Thesis

GRPN shares are severely undervalued, especially when accounting for equity investments in Sum-Up (valued at approx $18/GRPN). Ex-investments, GRPN's operating business is currently valued at a **Fwd P/E 1.55**, **Fwd PEG of 0.038**, and **Fwd P/S of 0.12**; in its entirety (inc. investments), GRPN is valued at Fwd P/E 10.9, Fwd PEG 0.267, and Fwd P/S of 0.68, still insanely good. For comparison, Peabody Energy (ticker BTU, a US coal company) currently trades at a Fwd P/E of 6.36 and Fwd P/S of 0.54. Fundamentally, this company screens extremely well.

Like many companies, GRPN initiated a strategy shift and **cost restructuring starting in 2020** (with related impairments occurring through 4Q21) that is finally **nearing an inflection point** for their business rebound. Despite impairments ending in 2021, the company is expected to continue realizing an additional $225m in cost savings in 2022. Coincidentally, this is also occurring as covid restrictions are easing. Both the restructuring and the ""post-covid normalization"" are intersecting at the perfect moment to **supercharge the company's profitability** as Americans return to activities outside the home and merchants return to the platform.

Additionally, they revised their accounting methods in 2020 to better account for their goods strategy which has been a drag on revenue comps in 2021, but will normalize in 2022 as it laps quarters since the change was implemented.

In Q3, the company also entered new partnerships with Google Pay and Square for distribution of inventory, a major win in increasing their audience that will help drive increasing volume.

The company just brought on a new CEO, Kedar Deshpande (former CEO of Zappos), and it's possible that he resets financials. However, I'd assign a low probability to this given that financials have already been reset over the restructuring period.

It's also worth noting that GRPN has a strong record of surpassing analyst estimates over the covid period, and as long as analysts stay cautiously optimistic, they're likely set up to continue leaping over the low bar. Given how depressed estimates are, this may allow them to overcome a key risk that earnings may be volatile following the Omicron surge in Dec-Jan in the US, though this may be neutralized by guidance commentary as the surge is a month behind us and there is likely more clarity on the road ahead.

There is also a high short interest on GRPN stock (\~19% of float) that has lazily remained in the stock as a short momentum play. Given this type of inflection point for the underlying business combined with the current market environment leading HFs to crowd into shorts, a strong rally on GRPN fundamentals from here would likely lead to an acceleration of short covering, driving the stock closer to fair value in a relatively short amount of time.

Tldr: GRPN severely undervalued, has a ton of hidden value from investments, and is at a key inflection point exiting a restructuring at the same time that demand should flow back to the platform. Sentiment is still cautious enough to create a phenomenal entry point, while short interest is extremely high, creating a potential short cover as lazy momentum shorts unwind.

# Current Valuation &amp; Financials

Fwd P/S ’22: 0.67

Revenue Growth Est: 0% '22, 7% '23

* Revenue is expected to stabilize in 2022, though I suspect this is a great setup for continued upside surprises, boosted by the Things to Do and Beauty Goods verticals that are leveraged to easing covid restrictions.

Fwd P/E 10.9

EPS Growth Est: +41% '22

* EPS expected to inflect higher as cost restructuring gains take hold and revenue stabilizes &amp; accelerates as the world reopens post-covid and merchants return to the platform.

Fwd EV/EBITDA: 3.05

EBITDA Growth Est: 27% '22, 13% '23

* Strong EBITDA growth a direct result of cost restructuring and continued cost improvements. GRPN has used the pandemic crisis to shift strategies and drastically improve efficiency of operations and profitability.

Free Cash Flow Generation: +140% YoY '22

* FCF is expected to turn positive in '22 for the first time since 2019. GRPN currently trades at a 12% Fwd FCF Yield, very high for a growth stock inflecting to reaccelerate revenues. 4Q21 FCF is expected to grow at 290% YoY, with 1Q22 expected to be the first decisively positive FCF Q1 ever.

Equity Investments

* Equity investments are the 1000lb elephant in the room. The latest earnings report revalued LT investments at $123m on the balance sheet, though in Jan 2022, it was reported that SumUp (of which GRPN own's 2.4%) was preparing to raise an funding round at a $22bil valuation. If successful at this valuation, their equity position in Sumup would equate to approx 528m, increasing their investments by over 4x. In turn, their balance sheet equity would actually equate to a higher total value than their current market cap.

Analyst Price Target: $37, +67.6% upside

* Analysts have gone stale, with 60% of PTs updated prior to 2022. By leaving GRPN in the cold on updates to institutional investors, this has created opportunities once the company reports on Feb 28 for models to be revised higher and sell-side sentiment to suddenly become more optimistic given the current inflection point.  

   * Barclays stated valuation is currently ""rock bottom"" and expects the marketing strategy to generate growth near term, though is waiting for confirmation of continued momentum before upgrading the stock from underweight.
   * JPMorgan is also cautiously optimistic that the 2020-21 restructuring efforts are about to pay off through higher growth and a more profitable business.
* A recent report by Prescience Point Capital Mgmt established a longer-term fair value range of $69-100+ when accounting for the operating business and investments.

# Company Description

Groupon operates an online marketplace for deals on local goods, services, travel, and attractions. Revenue is driven by commissions from sellers, with 60% of gross sales coming from North America. The company also has substantial holdings in equity investments, with their SumUp (fintech) assets estimated at approx $500m alone (current GRPN mkt cap \~$640m). The company brought on the former Zappos CEO as a permanent CEO in 4Q21, replacing the interim CEO.

# Thesis

GRPN shares are severely undervalued, especially when accounting for equity investments in Sum-Up (valued at approx $18/GRPN). Ex-investments, GRPN's operating business is currently valued at a **Fwd P/E 1.55**, **Fwd PEG of 0.038**, and **Fwd P/S of 0.12**; in its entirety (inc. investments), GRPN is valued at Fwd P/E 10.9, Fwd PEG 0.267, and Fwd P/S of 0.68, still insanely good. For comparison, Peabody Energy (ticker BTU, a US coal company) currently trades at a Fwd P/E of 6.36 and Fwd P/S of 0.54. Fundamentally, this company screens extremely well.

Like many companies, GRPN initiated a strategy shift and **cost restructuring starting in 2020** (with related impairments occurring through 4Q21) that is finally **nearing an inflection point** for their business rebound. Despite impairments ending in 2021, the company is expected to continue realizing an additional $225m in cost savings in 2022. Coincidentally, this is also occurring as covid restrictions are easing. Both the restructuring and the ""post-covid normalization"" are intersecting at the perfect moment to **supercharge the company's profitability** as Americans return to activities outside the home and merchants return to the platform.

Additionally, they revised their accounting methods in 2020 to better account for their goods strategy which has been a drag on revenue comps in 2021, but will normalize in 2022 as it laps quarters since the change was implemented.

In Q3, the company also entered new partnerships with Google Pay and Square for distribution of inventory, a major win in increasing their audience that will help drive increasing volume.

The company just brought on a new CEO, Kedar Deshpande (former CEO of Zappos), and it's possible that he resets financials. However, I'd assign a low probability to this given that financials have already been reset over the restructuring period.

It's also worth noting that GRPN has a strong record of surpassing analyst estimates over the covid period, and as long as analysts stay cautiously optimistic, they're likely set up to continue leaping over the low bar. Given how depressed estimates are, this may allow them to overcome a key risk that earnings may be volatile following the Omicron surge in Dec-Jan in the US, though this may be neutralized by guidance commentary as the surge is a month behind us and there is likely more clarity on the road ahead.

There is also a high short interest on GRPN stock (\~19% of float) that has lazily remained in the stock as a short momentum play. Given this type of inflection point for the underlying business combined with the current market environment leading HFs to crowd into shorts, a strong rally on GRPN fundamentals from here would likely lead to an acceleration of short covering, driving the stock closer to fair value in a relatively short amount of time.

Tldr: GRPN severely undervalued, has a ton of hidden value from investments, and is at a key inflection point exiting a restructuring at the same time that demand should flow back to the platform. Sentiment is still cautious enough to create a phenomenal entry point, while short interest is extremely high, creating a potential short squeeze as lazy momentum shorts unwind.

# Current Valuation &amp; Financials

Fwd P/S ’22: 0.67

Revenue Growth Est: 0% '22, 7% '23

* Revenue is expected to stabilize in 2022, though I suspect this is a great setup for continued upside surprises, boosted by the Things to Do and Beauty Goods verticals that are leveraged to easing covid restrictions.

Fwd P/E 10.9

EPS Growth Est: +41% '22

* EPS expected to inflect higher as cost restructuring gains take hold and revenue stabilizes &amp; accelerates as the world reopens post-covid and merchants return to the platform.

Fwd EV/EBITDA: 3.05

EBITDA Growth Est: 27% '22, 13% '23

* Strong EBITDA growth a direct result of cost restructuring and continued cost improvements. GRPN has used the pandemic crisis to shift strategies and drastically improve efficiency of operations and profitability.

Free Cash Flow Generation: +140% YoY '22

* FCF is expected to turn positive in '22 for the first time since 2019. GRPN currently trades at a 12% Fwd FCF Yield, very high for a growth stock inflecting to reaccelerate revenues. 4Q21 FCF is expected to grow at 290% YoY, with 1Q22 expected to be the first decisively positive FCF Q1 ever.

Equity Investments

* Equity investments are the 1000lb elephant in the room. The latest earnings report revalued LT investments at $123m on the balance sheet, though in Jan 2022, it was reported that SumUp (of which GRPN own's 2.4%) was preparing to raise an funding round at a $22bil valuation. If successful at this valuation, their equity position in Sumup would equate to approx 528m, increasing their investments by over 4x. In turn, their balance sheet equity would actually equate to a higher total value than their current market cap.

Analyst Price Target: $37, +67.6% upside

* Analysts have gone stale, with 60% of PTs updated prior to 2022. By leaving GRPN in the cold on updates to institutional investors, this has created opportunities once the company reports on Feb 28 for models to be revised higher and sell-side sentiment to suddenly become more optimistic given the current inflection point.
   * Barclays stated valuation is currently ""rock bottom"" and expects the marketing strategy to generate growth near term, though is waiting for confirmation of continued momentum before upgrading the stock from underweight. 
   * JPMorgan is also cautiously optimistic that the 2020-21 restructuring efforts are about to pay off through higher growth and a more profitable business.
* A recent report by Prescience Point Capital Mgmt established a longer-term fair value range of $69-100+ when accounting for the operating business and investments.

**TLDR2;** if you're too 'tarderd for the first one - two weeks ago the market Wile E. Coyote'd off a cliff, and in three weeks it's going to look down and hold up a sign that says ""oh no!""

I know, I know, I can hear you out there already, ""another stupid bear, stonks only go up, don't fight the FED"" etc etc.  So why should you listen to me?  How about because you know that 4% drop in SPY on 9/20 we had that fucked all of your portfolios sideways?  I fucking called that to the day [three months](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/og6ofy/housing_a_big_bubbly_pile_of_garbage_that_will/) ago.  Here's the relevant paragraph for those who can't be bothered to click on a link:  

&gt; My date range remains unchanged, sometime between June and November of this year. If you want some specific dates to watch, check July 12th, July 19th, August 23rd, September 20th, and October 25th. I probably like August 23rd the most of those, but I buy retard positions on WSB, so you definitely shouldn't listen to me. 

Let's review what happened on those dates:  July 12th, SPY went up 1%, July 19th, SPY dropped 3.4%, August 23rd, SPY went up .003%, September 20th, SPY dropped 4%.  Clearly I was wrong on July 12th, but that was also the date I had the weakest evidence for.  August 23rd for some reason was covered early the week before on the 18th and 19th.  So, you might be asking how did I know that we had market drops coming?  Well, it's pretty simple, I looked for dates when realized losses would hit.

Wait, what?  I predicted days the market would drop by looking for the days when people lost money?  Isn't that backwards?  Not really. Skip the next part if you don't care where the info comes from.  &gt;!See, one of the biggest and most asymmetric obstacles retail investors face in the market is information.  The big boys know when you're making your trades and front-run them with PFoF (payment for order flow - a practice where your broker sells your order information to a hedge fund, who uses computers and super high speed internet to sprint ahead of you in line, buy whatever you're going to buy, and then selling it to you at a higher price) giving you a worse price and skimming a tiny profit in the process.  The big boys know where your stop losses are at, they know where your buy limits are, and they will specifically dodge those or force hits on them depending on if their AI's tell them it's a good idea or not.!&lt;

&gt;!The best you can do for information on their positions is the 13F, which doesn't include a lot of the more popular types of trades anymore (everything swap related, any kind of bullshit insurance derivative, anything they entered AND left during the period between reporting dates, dark markets, some kinds of futures contracts, etc. etc.), and is at best 3 months out of date by the time you see it.  As a retail trader you have access to the following real-time data: futures contracts prices, stock prices, and the options chain.  The CFTC (commodities and futures trading commission) is doing everything it can to hide futures contracts prices, making them more opaque by the day, stock prices are so heavily manipulated by dark pool and naked short selling action that they're more lotto numbers than anything else.  (Don't believe me?  There's a video where an old guy with a phone and a pencil calls out price movements ahead of time hundreds of times in a row by looking at the level 2 data and cracking the code of how hedge fund and market maker algos use it to communicate with each other. No link because I just got off ban and the bots here can be touchy about links to YouTube.)  Oh, and after that video surfaced a couple people posted the actual rules those bots use to talk to each other, got forum slid off of every single reddit they appeared in within less than one day.!&lt;

&gt;!So what are we left with?  Mostly just the options chain, because it shows where the big boys think the prices are going, and if you cross it with the 13F data, you can sometimes find where a big player is exposed.  I will say the options chain is rapidly getting less reliable though.  Notice all the posts lately where they say ""get in now, the options chain is loaded for a gamma ramp!"" and then it doesn't happen?  Yeah, that's just a new spin on the old ""short squeeze"" pump and dump play.  The MM's and HF's sell the loaded chain naked, pump the stock above that point, chum up the waters to get retail to dive in, then naked short the fuck out of the stock to put it below the options, then do the slow bleed on price over the next few weeks to discourage people out of it, take a big position via dark pool, cover their shorts in the lit market to drive up the price, and repeat the whole damn process.  Stop falling for it folks. !&lt;

So, pinpointing when and how much these motherfuckers are going to lose gives us a good idea of how much they'll have to sell to cover their losses.  So, do we have any more known losses coming up?  Yes, yes we do.  And they are much, much, much fucking bigger.  The 7/19 and 9/20 losses were a couple of billion each.  But we're about to see a whole lot more than that on 10/20.  What happens on 10/20 you ask?  Well, that's 30 days from 9/20 - which is the first day that Evergrande missed paying the coupon on a USD denominated bond.  When a debt issuer misses a coupon payment, they've got 30 days to make it or the bond goes into default.  When bonds default, whatever secures them transfers over, in this case I believe it to be equity.  Well, guess what? Evergrande stock is fucking worthless.  So, a whole bunch of rich idiots are about to see an income generating security/collateral turn into junk stock, and realize losses.  This is going to fuck up their margin ratios, and make them sell a bunch of shit to get back in line.  T+2 from Oct 20 is Oct 22, which means Oct 25 suddenly looks pretty fuckin' spicy. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zpi2qlqn82r71.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5612457db3055bda0c5640006d8c11014e35bd43

The 9/20 coupon payment isn't the only one Evergrande has missed.  There's also the 9/23, and the 9/29 payments that have been missed.  Those hit 30 days on 10/23 and 10/27.  Maybe you saw some nonsense about EG paying making some debt payments lately?  Yeah, they paid the 9/23 coupon - for ONSHORE bonds, ie Yuan denominated debt, and they paid it ""partially in kind"" which means they handed over some parking spots and unfinished property that has negative value after you add up the costs to clear the half-finished buildings off of it.  They haven't paid shit on the money owed to foreigners, ie the $305B they owe in USD bonds.  These aren't the end of it either, there are additional coupon payments hitting basically every week until they've cycled through every single USD bond they have outstanding.

Now, if you're smarter than the average retard, you might start wondering at this point, who the biggest bagholders for that $305B in bad bonds is.  Well, let me tell you.  First, we've got the RBC (Royal Bank of Canada), which has $46B in EG bonds - and a market cap of $144B.  If you were wondering why there was that weird AH (after hours - the stock dropped 64% AH in one day, then ""fixed the glitch"" and went back up) mess with RBC about six months ago where it looked worthless and totally fucked for a minute?  Yeah, that was an actual view of the banks real financial state when these bonds hit zero.  This is also why Trudeau called elections early, because once this shitshow hits, nobody's getting re-elected.  This is also why if you check the Canadian TV broadcasts for NFL games a week ago, you'll find commercials stating that bank deposits are insured by the government.  They're prepping the public to try and avoid bank runs.  Here's a photo if you don't believe me:

&amp;#x200B;

[That's from a CDIC \(Canadian Deposit Insurance Company\) commercial that ran during last weeks NFL games](https://preview.redd.it/fx5tlaefc2r71.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=064cbea11f992a3da569345cf37de79c86d283d5)

On a sidenote, if this makes you nervous about the Fed's requirement that banks have $1 Trillion in high quality capital reserves on hand for a severe recession by 10/1, or BofA's massive issues with online banking and ATM's not working yesterday?  Well, it fucking should.

Next up we've got HSBC - the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited - I don't actually have a ton of info on them, but I've heard some bad rumors, and they probably fuk in general, but I don't have enough solid data to say anything with great certainty.  If you do, chime in in the comments  or DM me and I'll add it in here in an edit.

Finally, we've got Blackrock, the 4th branch of govt, with trillions of USD AUM (united states dollar assets under management).  They are very heavily exposed to Chinese junk debt from the real estate and property development sectors.  Their stock is down 10.5% on the month, which is more than SPY is over the same period, even counting from the ATH (all time high).

However, it's not just Evergrande that's a problem.  It's all the Chinese property development companies, and all of their foreign denominated debt. China recently started arresting executives from HNA - which is another huge developer, and SINIC stock has been suspended from trading for almost a month now after it fell 80%.  These are all big developers that are utterly fucked, EG is just the first domino to fall.  So, there is a lot more pain still to come.

I'd also like to take a second to dispel the myth that Xi - a hardline communist dictator - is going to bail out a bunch of western capitalists.  Because he's not.  Politicians work to their incentives.  Western politicians bail out banks and wall street because they keep power by making their rich donors happy.  Chinese politicians keep power by making the economy go up and maintaining domestic stability.  Neither of their goals is achieved by giving money to foreigners.  Also, they've got massive problems at home to worry about [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pyzpp1/the_2nd_largest_economy_on_earth_is_shitting_the/) post sums up just a few of the problems, but fails to address what's probably the biggest one, which is the 1.6 million apartments that Evergrande took money to build... but didn't.  And EG isn't the only one who pulled this.  The people, they are NOT happy about it.  They're already taking executives hostage, and protesting in public, both huge no-nos in China.  When they start grabbing bankers and low-ranking party officials... that's where the bad stuff really starts.

Ok, ok, maybe you're not a China boogeyman, maybe you don't like the idea of realized losses.  Maybe you're a big fan of charts, TA (technical analysis) and astrology for men.  Ok, then here's the six month SPX chart:

&amp;#x200B;

[See the nice shampoo commercial that's formed over the last two months on the YTD \(year to date\) SPX chart?  ](https://preview.redd.it/2tiyksdes2r71.png?width=1858&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=127b5677b00742c3d584e96372871b6fd1ec8368)

So, yeah, that's a clear head and shoulders that formed from August through the end of September.  On the SPX chart, at the end of a year and a half in which the market MORE THAN DOUBLED during a historic pandemic.  Surely the trend turning downwards won't be equally violent.  Surely.

So now let's move on from chart patterns to our good friend Elliot Waves.  Here's an example of a textbook Elliot Wave pattern, just so you know what we're talking about.

https://preview.redd.it/dtb5yhfoo2r71.jpg?width=259&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6866fe024ae207e0f5ef2db89c5e1fa4c0cc71e0

Now, let's look at an elliot wave chart of the market

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/09hpda2j03r71.gif

Oh whoops, my bad, that's not actually today's market, that's what things looked like in 2008 right before the crash.  Well, I'm sure today is different, right?

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vde6iw8s13r71.jpg?width=665&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f66c8a45452cb5688f593d3830d942b0d0de70b1

Ok, yeah, those are TOTALLY different pictures.  Right?  Right???  

Those are both taken from work by Robert Prather, who is really good at Elliot Waves, even if he is pretty dumb about other stuff.  And if you're wondering, yes this picture is pre-covid, so there's a final blip dip/spike missing, but it doesn't change that much of anything if they're there.  But if you need something truly wild that lights up your tinfoil and points to 2021, then I give you this masterpiece.

&amp;#x200B;

[Yeah, it really does work out with the years and everything.  Somebody call Nic Cage already.](https://preview.redd.it/3kjf206573r71.jpg?width=999&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc4c3978d2286339f2dcda430bea69b66e25d33b)

&amp;#x200B;

And one final chart of a particular stock that provides a large amount of idiosyncratic risk to the markets.

[Two weeks to wedge close and price breakout!](https://preview.redd.it/spxx4wyek3r71.jpg?width=2270&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8de41478d2382e4f939f4c28d8de1ebaf9006ac)

Taken from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/px5a35/months_long_trend_lines_on_gme_about_to_collide/) because u/originalspaceman1 drew it much better than I could.  Anyways, that 9 month wedge closes around October 14th or 15th.  Look, whether you agree or not with the whole GME Ape Saga, IF they're right, that is going to blow up the entire goddamn market.

Need more rainbow bear porn?  Ok, don't worry fam, I gotchu covered.  On this coming Monday, 10/4, Biden is unveiling his new China trade policy.  And from early leaks it looks strongly like he's going to take Trumps trade war, re-brand it, and make it smarter and less damaging to us.  

The eviction ban is over, and for some reason the expected mass wave of evictions hasn't happened yet - which means it's still coming.  A Census Bureau poll showed 3 million American households are very concerned about imminent eviction, the number of Americans behind on their rent varies from estimates of 6 million behind on rent from Moody's to 15 million behind on rent from the Aspen Institute.  Best guess?  Stuff is still working its way through the courts and there is lots of pain to come.  

The European energy crisis looks really, really bad early on, with people in Britain getting knifed in gas lines and the Army coming out to guard fuel transports.  Those are from headlines on CNN if you're wondering about the source.  

Inflation continues to run rampant.  Two of the local greasy spoons near my office have raised prices and come out with new menus in the last month, every trip to the grocery store I see something else is more expensive now, Germany - which is like, allergic to inflation on a genetic level - just posted a 4.1% increase YoY (Year over Year).

So, let's just sum everything up - 

* China is all kinds of fucked up
* Massive realized losses incoming that have to actually be accounted for
* Canadian TV reminding people that bank deposits are insured
* Head and Shoulders bearish pattern on the yearly SPX chart
* Elliot Waves say historic bomb incoming
* Tons more domestic pain from evictions still to arrive
* Energy crises in Europe and China
* Palantir - which is basically corporate SkyNet warns of a ""black swan event""
* GameStop finally going off or going away
* Historic record amounts of margin
* The CMBS loan market is full of shit and garbage like the MBS market in 2008

Ok, so what plays to make?  Well, basically, puts on everything and calls on anything inverse.  I think we have 2-3 market pumps left in the next three weeks before shit starts really going downhill.  One will be on whatever infrastructure deal passes, one will be on the debt ceiling getting resolved (Senate floor time on is actually a massive, and very unrecognized risk on that because nobody, including half of DC, can actually be bothered to understand how things work), and we might or might not get some kind of random ""miracle technology"" or whatever pump from the press.

All of those pumps WILL be used by the big boys to dump bags on to you, the retail investor.  Don't FOMO, don't buy the dip, take the rise in prices as a buying opportunity to go the other way.  These are my current positions, and I'm looking for market bumps to add more to them.

And, a very important quote from [my first](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oe9ruu/how_to_play_the_upcoming_market_crash/) DD on the crash which listed a June-November time range:

&gt;and remember, after September, comes October

Ok, actually, I don't remember which piece that quote was from, but it's fucking true.  We're going down like a virgin in a submarine in just three weeks, make sure you've got a lifejacket.",We're All Fucked! - The Gay Bear Porn You Need for the Mega Crash,4,1,"We're All Fucked! - The Gay Bear Porn You Need for the Mega Crash **TLDR;** if you're 'tarded - basically just play a clip of President Camacho giving his state of the union, then remove the smart guy who's going to fix everything part   

**TLDR2;** if you're too 'tarderd for the first one - two weeks ago the market Wile E. Coyote'd off a cliff, and in three weeks it's going to look down and hold up a sign that says ""oh no!""

I know, I know, I can hear you out there already, ""another stupid bear, stonks only go up, don't fight the FED"" etc etc.  So why should you listen to me?  How about because you know that 4% drop in SPY on 9/20 we had that fucked all of your portfolios sideways?  I fucking called that to the day [three months](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/og6ofy/housing_a_big_bubbly_pile_of_garbage_that_will/) ago.  Here's the relevant paragraph for those who can't be bothered to click on a link:  

&gt; My date range remains unchanged, sometime between June and November of this year. If you want some specific dates to watch, check July 12th, July 19th, August 23rd, September 20th, and October 25th. I probably like August 23rd the most of those, but I buy retard positions on WSB, so you definitely shouldn't listen to me. 

Let's review what happened on those dates:  July 12th, SPY went up 1%, July 19th, SPY dropped 3.4%, August 23rd, SPY went up .003%, September 20th, SPY dropped 4%.  Clearly I was wrong on July 12th, but that was also the date I had the weakest evidence for.  August 23rd for some reason was covered early the week before on the 18th and 19th.  So, you might be asking how did I know that we had market drops coming?  Well, it's pretty simple, I looked for dates when realized losses would hit.

Wait, what?  I predicted days the market would drop by looking for the days when people lost money?  Isn't that backwards?  Not really. Skip the next part if you don't care where the info comes from.  &gt;!See, one of the biggest and most asymmetric obstacles retail investors face in the market is information.  The big boys know when you're making your trades and front-run them with PFoF (payment for order flow - a practice where your broker sells your order information to a hedge fund, who uses computers and super high speed internet to sprint ahead of you in line, buy whatever you're going to buy, and then selling it to you at a higher price) giving you a worse price and skimming a tiny profit in the process.  The big boys know where your stop losses are at, they know where your buy limits are, and they will specifically dodge those or force hits on them depending on if their AI's tell them it's a good idea or not.!&lt;

&gt;!The best you can do for information on their positions is the 13F, which doesn't include a lot of the more popular types of trades anymore (everything swap related, any kind of bullshit insurance derivative, anything they entered AND left during the period between reporting dates, dark markets, some kinds of futures contracts, etc. etc.), and is at best 3 months out of date by the time you see it.  As a retail trader you have access to the following real-time data: futures contracts prices, stock prices, and the options chain.  The CFTC (commodities and futures trading commission) is doing everything it can to hide futures contracts prices, making them more opaque by the day, stock prices are so heavily manipulated by dark pool and naked short selling action that they're more lotto numbers than anything else.  (Don't believe me?  There's a video where an old guy with a phone and a pencil calls out price movements ahead of time hundreds of times in a row by looking at the level 2 data and cracking the code of how hedge fund and market maker algos use it to communicate with each other. No link because I just got off ban and the bots here can be touchy about links to YouTube.)  Oh, and after that video surfaced a couple people posted the actual rules those bots use to talk to each other, got forum slid off of every single reddit they appeared in within less than one day.!&lt;

&gt;!So what are we left with?  Mostly just the options chain, because it shows where the big boys think the prices are going, and if you cross it with the 13F data, you can sometimes find where a big player is exposed.  I will say the options chain is rapidly getting less reliable though.  Notice all the posts lately where they say ""get in now, the options chain is loaded for a gamma ramp!"" and then it doesn't happen?  Yeah, that's just a new spin on the old ""short squeeze"" pump and dump play.  The MM's and HF's sell the loaded chain naked, pump the stock above that point, chum up the waters to get retail to dive in, then naked short the fuck out of the stock to put it below the options, then do the slow bleed on price over the next few weeks to discourage people out of it, take a big position via dark pool, cover their shorts in the lit market to drive up the price, and repeat the whole damn process.  Stop falling for it folks. !&lt;

So, pinpointing when and how much these motherfuckers are going to lose gives us a good idea of how much they'll have to sell to cover their losses.  So, do we have any more known losses coming up?  Yes, yes we do.  And they are much, much, much fucking bigger.  The 7/19 and 9/20 losses were a couple of billion each.  But we're about to see a whole lot more than that on 10/20.  What happens on 10/20 you ask?  Well, that's 30 days from 9/20 - which is the first day that Evergrande missed paying the coupon on a USD denominated bond.  When a debt issuer misses a coupon payment, they've got 30 days to make it or the bond goes into default.  When bonds default, whatever secures them transfers over, in this case I believe it to be equity.  Well, guess what? Evergrande stock is fucking worthless.  So, a whole bunch of rich idiots are about to see an income generating security/collateral turn into junk stock, and realize losses.  This is going to fuck up their margin ratios, and make them sell a bunch of shit to get back in line.  T+2 from Oct 20 is Oct 22, which means Oct 25 suddenly looks pretty fuckin' spicy. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zpi2qlqn82r71.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5612457db3055bda0c5640006d8c11014e35bd43

The 9/20 coupon payment isn't the only one Evergrande has missed.  There's also the 9/23, and the 9/29 payments that have been missed.  Those hit 30 days on 10/23 and 10/27.  Maybe you saw some nonsense about EG paying making some debt payments lately?  Yeah, they paid the 9/23 coupon - for ONSHORE bonds, ie Yuan denominated debt, and they paid it ""partially in kind"" which means they handed over some parking spots and unfinished property that has negative value after you add up the costs to clear the half-finished buildings off of it.  They haven't paid shit on the money owed to foreigners, ie the $305B they owe in USD bonds.  These aren't the end of it either, there are additional coupon payments hitting basically every week until they've cycled through every single USD bond they have outstanding.

Now, if you're smarter than the average retard, you might start wondering at this point, who the biggest bagholders for that $305B in bad bonds is.  Well, let me tell you.  First, we've got the RBC (Royal Bank of Canada), which has $46B in EG bonds - and a market cap of $144B.  If you were wondering why there was that weird AH (after hours - the stock dropped 64% AH in one day, then ""fixed the glitch"" and went back up) mess with RBC about six months ago where it looked worthless and totally fucked for a minute?  Yeah, that was an actual view of the banks real financial state when these bonds hit zero.  This is also why Trudeau called elections early, because once this shitshow hits, nobody's getting re-elected.  This is also why if you check the Canadian TV broadcasts for NFL games a week ago, you'll find commercials stating that bank deposits are insured by the government.  They're prepping the public to try and avoid bank runs.  Here's a photo if you don't believe me:

&amp;#x200B;

[That's from a CDIC \(Canadian Deposit Insurance Company\) commercial that ran during last weeks NFL games](https://preview.redd.it/fx5tlaefc2r71.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=064cbea11f992a3da569345cf37de79c86d283d5)

On a sidenote, if this makes you nervous about the Fed's requirement that banks have $1 Trillion in high quality capital reserves on hand for a severe recession by 10/1, or BofA's massive issues with online banking and ATM's not working yesterday?  Well, it fucking should.

Next up we've got HSBC - the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited - I don't actually have a ton of info on them, but I've heard some bad rumors, and they probably fuk in general, but I don't have enough solid data to say anything with great certainty.  If you do, chime in in the comments  or DM me and I'll add it in here in an edit.

Finally, we've got Blackrock, the 4th branch of govt, with trillions of USD AUM (united states dollar assets under management).  They are very heavily exposed to Chinese junk debt from the real estate and property development sectors.  Their stock is down 10.5% on the month, which is more than SPY is over the same period, even counting from the ATH (all time high).

However, it's not just Evergrande that's a problem.  It's all the Chinese property development companies, and all of their foreign denominated debt. China recently started arresting executives from HNA - which is another huge developer, and SINIC stock has been suspended from trading for almost a month now after it fell 80%.  These are all big developers that are utterly fucked, EG is just the first domino to fall.  So, there is a lot more pain still to come.

I'd also like to take a second to dispel the myth that Xi - a hardline communist dictator - is going to bail out a bunch of western capitalists.  Because he's not.  Politicians work to their incentives.  Western politicians bail out banks and wall street because they keep power by making their rich donors happy.  Chinese politicians keep power by making the economy go up and maintaining domestic stability.  Neither of their goals is achieved by giving money to foreigners.  Also, they've got massive problems at home to worry about [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pyzpp1/the_2nd_largest_economy_on_earth_is_shitting_the/) post sums up just a few of the problems, but fails to address what's probably the biggest one, which is the 1.6 million apartments that Evergrande took money to build... but didn't.  And EG isn't the only one who pulled this.  The people, they are NOT happy about it.  They're already taking executives hostage, and protesting in public, both huge no-nos in China.  When they start grabbing bankers and low-ranking party officials... that's where the bad stuff really starts.

Ok, ok, maybe you're not a China boogeyman, maybe you don't like the idea of realized losses.  Maybe you're a big fan of charts, TA (technical analysis) and astrology for men.  Ok, then here's the six month SPX chart:

&amp;#x200B;

[See the nice shampoo commercial that's formed over the last two months on the YTD \(year to date\) SPX chart?  ](https://preview.redd.it/2tiyksdes2r71.png?width=1858&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=127b5677b00742c3d584e96372871b6fd1ec8368)

So, yeah, that's a clear head and shoulders that formed from August through the end of September.  On the SPX chart, at the end of a year and a half in which the market MORE THAN DOUBLED during a historic pandemic.  Surely the trend turning downwards won't be equally violent.  Surely.

So now let's move on from chart patterns to our good friend Elliot Waves.  Here's an example of a textbook Elliot Wave pattern, just so you know what we're talking about.

https://preview.redd.it/dtb5yhfoo2r71.jpg?width=259&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6866fe024ae207e0f5ef2db89c5e1fa4c0cc71e0

Now, let's look at an elliot wave chart of the market

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/09hpda2j03r71.gif

Oh whoops, my bad, that's not actually today's market, that's what things looked like in 2008 right before the crash.  Well, I'm sure today is different, right?

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vde6iw8s13r71.jpg?width=665&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f66c8a45452cb5688f593d3830d942b0d0de70b1

Ok, yeah, those are TOTALLY different pictures.  Right?  Right???  

Those are both taken from work by Robert Prather, who is really good at Elliot Waves, even if he is pretty dumb about other stuff.  And if you're wondering, yes this picture is pre-covid, so there's a final blip dip/spike missing, but it doesn't change that much of anything if they're there.  But if you need something truly wild that lights up your tinfoil and points to 2021, then I give you this masterpiece.

&amp;#x200B;

[Yeah, it really does work out with the years and everything.  Somebody call Nic Cage already.](https://preview.redd.it/3kjf206573r71.jpg?width=999&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc4c3978d2286339f2dcda430bea69b66e25d33b)

&amp;#x200B;

And one final chart of a particular stock that provides a large amount of idiosyncratic risk to the markets.

[Two weeks to wedge close and price breakout!](https://preview.redd.it/spxx4wyek3r71.jpg?width=2270&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8de41478d2382e4f939f4c28d8de1ebaf9006ac)

Taken from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/px5a35/months_long_trend_lines_on_gme_about_to_collide/) because u/originalspaceman1 drew it much better than I could.  Anyways, that 9 month wedge closes around October 14th or 15th.  Look, whether you agree or not with the whole GME Ape Saga, IF they're right, that is going to blow up the entire goddamn market.

Need more rainbow bear porn?  Ok, don't worry fam, I gotchu covered.  On this coming Monday, 10/4, Biden is unveiling his new China trade policy.  And from early leaks it looks strongly like he's going to take Trumps trade war, re-brand it, and make it smarter and less damaging to us.  

The eviction ban is over, and for some reason the expected mass wave of evictions hasn't happened yet - which means it's still coming.  A Census Bureau poll showed 3 million American households are very concerned about imminent eviction, the number of Americans behind on their rent varies from estimates of 6 million behind on rent from Moody's to 15 million behind on rent from the Aspen Institute.  Best guess?  Stuff is still working its way through the courts and there is lots of pain to come.  

The European energy crisis looks really, really bad early on, with people in Britain getting knifed in gas lines and the Army coming out to guard fuel transports.  Those are from headlines on CNN if you're wondering about the source.  

Inflation continues to run rampant.  Two of the local greasy spoons near my office have raised prices and come out with new menus in the last month, every trip to the grocery store I see something else is more expensive now, Germany - which is like, allergic to inflation on a genetic level - just posted a 4.1% increase YoY (Year over Year).

So, let's just sum everything up - 

* China is all kinds of fucked up
* Massive realized losses incoming that have to actually be accounted for
* Canadian TV reminding people that bank deposits are insured
* Head and Shoulders bearish pattern on the yearly SPX chart
* Elliot Waves say historic bomb incoming
* Tons more domestic pain from evictions still to arrive
* Energy crises in Europe and China
* Palantir - which is basically corporate SkyNet warns of a ""black swan event""
* GameStop finally going off or going away
* Historic record amounts of margin
* The CMBS loan market is full of shit and garbage like the MBS market in 2008

Ok, so what plays to make?  Well, basically, puts on everything and calls on anything inverse.  I think we have 2-3 market pumps left in the next three weeks before shit starts really going downhill.  One will be on whatever infrastructure deal passes, one will be on the debt ceiling getting resolved (Senate floor time on is actually a massive, and very unrecognized risk on that because nobody, including half of DC, can actually be bothered to understand how things work), and we might or might not get some kind of random ""miracle technology"" or whatever pump from the press.

All of those pumps WILL be used by the big boys to dump bags on to you, the retail investor.  Don't FOMO, don't buy the dip, take the rise in prices as a buying opportunity to go the other way.  These are my current positions, and I'm looking for market bumps to add more to them.

Autists, lend me your ears.

Pfizers guide for 2022 is 1.7 billion doses. See slide 35.

&gt;https://investors.pfizer.com/investors-overview/default.aspx

But if you notice, they are manufacturing 4 billion doses. That's means pfizer expects all these countries to execute the options on their contract for bi-annual boosters. This is just like the option the EU has on the contract below.

That means pfizers actual vaccine sales will double current guidance, and revenue will be 120B for FY2022 and beyond.

FY2021 REVENUE = 40B (VACCINE) + 40B (OTHER) = 80B

It's all because the virus reinfects quickly, and repeatedly.

Again, full credit to YieldFanatic and YieldFanatic.com as I’m too retarded to do a DD like this one. But to be fair I tried to tell you retards about HIMAX a while back. YieldFanatic’s DD is more on the spectrum than mine though;

7th November 2021
Welcome to the Yield Fanatic’s Trade Idea series. This write up is on the Taiwanese
semiconductor business, Himax. The shares are listed on NASDAQ and the ticker is $HIMX.
The date of write up is 7th November 2021 – as I write this, $HIMX’s current share price is $11.45 and market cap is roughly $2.0 billion. Note that this isn’t part of the deep dive series like I mostly present but rather a unique tactical trade idea given where this company trades at the moment.
But as always, before we start, the disclaimer. A few points worth noting:
Firstly, this is not investment advice nor is it a recommendation to buy or sell any security. This is just the Yield Fanatic’s opinion of the stock in question. If you wish to seek advice, please do so from an accredited financial advisor, which the Yield Fanatic is not.
Secondly, the opinion shown in this presentation is based on Yield’s read of things. Your view may be different based on your read of things, but it is the difference in views and opinion that makes a market.
The aim of this write up and recording is to give you an unbiased VIEW of the opportunity in question. The aim is to give you all the data that you need to make your own decision.
And finally, the Yield Fanatic does have a position in Himax at present and so, the opinions expressed here may be biased. This is a name that I have traded in the past and which I will continually trade in and out of.
To be clear, the Yield Fanatic does reserve to trade or invest in the name, subject to views and valuation at that specific point in time.
   Finally and before we start, note that this was originally written up for the purpose of posting on Reddit, so the tone may seem different to the one normally adopted on my other pieces of work.
 $HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present. TLDR:
 1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company – trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!
 The shares are cheap in a more “normal” S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as stupid cheap with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation
 2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.
3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4’21 and even Q1’22, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have consistently delivered

 results “to guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether.
 4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year – representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.
 5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.
  ..and now for the fun bit:
 6. Potential for a significant short squeeze. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were ~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to ~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.
 The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short – and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “GME X’mas special”.
7. Cant confirm this (unconfirmed hearsay) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up..... and it has already shot up ~15% last couple of weeks.
  Disclosure: I own stock + Jan’22 and Mar’22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan’22 and $10 Mar’22).
 
 What does $HIMX do? Products?
 Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here’s a quick snippet of what Himax does:
$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make ‘panels’ which are, in turn, used in:
 - Large sized DDICs -&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc
 - Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs -&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc
   In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:
- High end Timing Controller which improves power efficiency in displays
   - WiseEye ultra power AI --&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ AI and ML to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet
 of Things (IoT) area.
 
  - Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays – with usage in AR/VR glasses, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), Holographic Displays, etc.
 
- Other products in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)
  As a summary – the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:
 
Revenue by segment:
Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) – with Automotive OEM representing ~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs ~12.5%.
  However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.
The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.
  
 Competitors and Market Shares:
In the Q3’21 presentation (available here), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).
You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.
As for market share by the individual segments, as of Q3’21, $HIMX’s market shares were:
   - Large DDIC: 10.5%
  - Smartphones: 10.4%
 - Tablets: 37.7% but note that $HIMX has &gt; 60% market share of Android / non iOS tablets – the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.
   - Automotive OEM: 32.8%
  So, what has been happening recently with Himax?
2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.
Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products.
 
 $HIMX management foresaw that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes”, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.
When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially.... and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.
Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX
 found itself in a very sweet spot.
This gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked. When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players), $HIMX walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!
This allowed it to take a decent amount of market share over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.
So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?
$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) .....but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like Internet of Things (IoT) and Automotive/vehicles.
In addition, the modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV) would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.
   
 On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such 5G and high performance computing (HPC) – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its DDIC business used.
In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for, some time ago.
I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.
Isn’t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?
As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 – this is from a combination of
  more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.
However, $HIMX was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand.... and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.
$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.
So yes, for now – the demand will persist, and as management has said, this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage.
Now, that’s the background. Supply secured along with said demand.
SHORT SQUEEZE
Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear Short Squeeze candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 – and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the “GME X’mas special”.
So, why do I mention a ‘SHORT SQUEEZE’ – well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest
  is around 24.7m shares, representing ~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting ~11 days to cover.
However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.
Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of “short availability utilization”. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “GME X’mas special”.
 
 With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.
 https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) – so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.
  
 As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun’21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.
The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs.
I understand the short-thesis – I really do.
Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.
The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent
guidance seems to suggest otherwise.
I can personally find NO REASON to be short this stock anymore at least for the next 7 months, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4’21 and decent outlook for Q1’22) and then we will have a dividend payment in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).
From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.
The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.
But now, its time for a reversal.
   
 The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)
$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul’21).
The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been ~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.
So far, YTD Q3’21, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.
  An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!
That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.
The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July – so we have some time. But let’s face it, everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.
Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. An earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks.
Company has bought back shares previously – and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so I wouldn’t put a potential stock buyback past the company.
All in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen ~15% over the last few weeks, it’s quite a surprise that the stock hasn’t rallied much more.
More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).
A question from the “Growth Bros”: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?
A common question – and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.
  But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light. So, 2 points worth noting:
1. Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is ‘reinvestment’. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
   2. Reasonably capex-light business: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.
  Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

 - R&amp;D – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and
  - Capex - including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase
 In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their ‘investment phase’, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.
So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so, why hasn’t
  the share price gone up then?
Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.
Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20’s performance) as well.
Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.
  Hedge Funds’ share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 – when performance improved dramatically.
 
 Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.
Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.
So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn’t stock kept pace?
Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.
   Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. More on valuation at the end.
The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION! Folks believe that this stock is manipulated by Market Makers (MMs) who are often option sellers on $HIMX. Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed.
With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it’s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!
Q3 Earnings
Now – let’s discuss the recent earnings
Q3’21 revenue: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)
Q3’21 gross margin: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2’21 and vs 22.3% in Q3’20 (guidance was 50.5-52%) Q3’21 EBITDA: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here! Q3’21 Levered FCF of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.
  The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.
 
 Charts for annual performance incl LTM Sep’21 and YTD Sep’21 are shown below:
 So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.
 
 GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market
 Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.
Why was the market waiting on guidance? Because indications were that:
(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,
(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline) (c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)
 Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure......or at least that’s what the shorts were betting on.
Before I go into $HIMX’s guidance, let’s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) – which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4
+
its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:
 - Q4’21 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and
  - Q4’21 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.
 This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) – so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.
But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:
 - Q4 revenue would INCREASE by +4% to +8% q-o-q,
  - Gross margin: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)
  - Q4 IFRS EPS (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs
 prior year (Q4’20) of $0.195 → i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!
  - Q4 non IFRS EPS (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)
 Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!
To be fair, the margin decrease is more of a dilutionary effect than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.
“It’s simple math”, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX’s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.
 
 However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact.
But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through. In other words – earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.
This level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)
Mr. Lopez’s question is below:
 The answer to this question was pretty much that
a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 – FY19), and
   b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’.
  Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “again and
 again and again” (yes, 3 again’s specifically mentioned) – and notes that guidance this time is no different.
In fact, if you look at $HIMX’s historical guidance, you will see that the company has consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1’17) – and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.
 
 So yes – as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this “again and again and again”!!! Let’s just say management is highly credible.
Top line guidance by segment:
- Large DDIC – to GROW by high single digit q-o-q helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.
- Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC (overall) – GROW low teens q-o-q and &gt;50% yoy By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:
   - Smartphones -&gt; GROW high teens q-o-q &amp; &gt;30% yoy
 - Tablet -&gt; flat q-o-q, and
   - Automotive -&gt; GROW double-digit q-o-q and &gt;100% yoy. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX’s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.
 Interestingly within the Smartphone segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features”.
Also, and more importantly “successful engagements with some key customers have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches”. i.e. winning more market share.
Lots to like here.
Automotive is $HIMX’s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share. Company notes that the “increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle
is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle”.
Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need
 to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.
 
 As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC segment, which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.
This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application (industrial application, from what I gather) – which is on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures).
 In addition, $HIMX also notes that the number of awarded projects in this segment is growing rapidly, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical...”to name a few”. Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.
$HIMX also notes “within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company’s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from cloud service providers who look for secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services”. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.
$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year. This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future.
 
 VALUATION &amp; Conclusion
The chart below compares Himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.
However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers – with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.
The average fair value on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 – representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.
  As for transaction comps, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents 21x EV/EBITDA – which if applied to $HIMX, gives a FV of $54/share or +370% upside!
Is $54/share possible here? Absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a few steps ahead of competition with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its
 existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.
We haven’t even discussed $HIMX’s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long- term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).
But I’d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game”, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.
Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary – although, that is probably some time away.
For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.
Let’s squeeze this one dry. GME X’mas special.

7th November 2021
Welcome to the Yield Fanatic’s Trade Idea series. This write up is on the Taiwanese
semiconductor business, Himax. The shares are listed on NASDAQ and the ticker is $HIMX.
The date of write up is 7th November 2021 – as I write this, $HIMX’s current share price is $11.45 and market cap is roughly $2.0 billion. Note that this isn’t part of the deep dive series like I mostly present but rather a unique tactical trade idea given where this company trades at the moment.
But as always, before we start, the disclaimer. A few points worth noting:
Firstly, this is not investment advice nor is it a recommendation to buy or sell any security. This is just the Yield Fanatic’s opinion of the stock in question. If you wish to seek advice, please do so from an accredited financial advisor, which the Yield Fanatic is not.
Secondly, the opinion shown in this presentation is based on Yield’s read of things. Your view may be different based on your read of things, but it is the difference in views and opinion that makes a market.
The aim of this write up and recording is to give you an unbiased VIEW of the opportunity in question. The aim is to give you all the data that you need to make your own decision.
And finally, the Yield Fanatic does have a position in Himax at present and so, the opinions expressed here may be biased. This is a name that I have traded in the past and which I will continually trade in and out of.
To be clear, the Yield Fanatic does reserve to trade or invest in the name, subject to views and valuation at that specific point in time.
   Finally and before we start, note that this was originally written up for the purpose of posting on Reddit, so the tone may seem different to the one normally adopted on my other pieces of work.
 $HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present. TLDR:
 1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company – trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!
 The shares are cheap in a more “normal” S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as stupid cheap with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation
 2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.
3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4’21 and even Q1’22, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have consistently delivered

 results “to guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether.
 4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year – representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.
 5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.
  ..and now for the fun bit:
 6. Potential for a significant short squeeze. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were ~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to ~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.
 The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short – and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “GME X’mas special”.
7. Cant confirm this (unconfirmed hearsay) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up..... and it has already shot up ~15% last couple of weeks.
  Disclosure: I own stock + Jan’22 and Mar’22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan’22 and $10 Mar’22).
 
 What does $HIMX do? Products?
 Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here’s a quick snippet of what Himax does:
$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make ‘panels’ which are, in turn, used in:
 - Large sized DDICs -&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc
 - Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs -&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc
   In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:
- High end Timing Controller which improves power efficiency in displays
   - WiseEye ultra power AI --&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ AI and ML to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet
 of Things (IoT) area.
 
  - Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays – with usage in AR/VR glasses, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), Holographic Displays, etc.
 
- Other products in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)
  As a summary – the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:
 
Revenue by segment:
Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) – with Automotive OEM representing ~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs ~12.5%.
  However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.
The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.
  
 Competitors and Market Shares:
In the Q3’21 presentation (available here), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).
You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.
As for market share by the individual segments, as of Q3’21, $HIMX’s market shares were:
   - Large DDIC: 10.5%
  - Smartphones: 10.4%
 - Tablets: 37.7% but note that $HIMX has &gt; 60% market share of Android / non iOS tablets – the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.
   - Automotive OEM: 32.8%
  So, what has been happening recently with Himax?
2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.
Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products.
 
 $HIMX management foresaw that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes”, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.
When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially.... and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.
Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX
 found itself in a very sweet spot.
This gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked. When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players), $HIMX walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!
This allowed it to take a decent amount of market share over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.
So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?
$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) .....but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like Internet of Things (IoT) and Automotive/vehicles.
In addition, the modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV) would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.
   
 On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such 5G and high performance computing (HPC) – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its DDIC business used.
In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for, some time ago.
I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.
Isn’t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?
As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 – this is from a combination of
  more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.
However, $HIMX was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand.... and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.
$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.
So yes, for now – the demand will persist, and as management has said, this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage.
Now, that’s the background. Supply secured along with said demand.
SHORT SQUEEZE
Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear Short Squeeze candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 – and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the “GME X’mas special”.
So, why do I mention a ‘SHORT SQUEEZE’ – well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest
  is around 24.7m shares, representing ~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting ~11 days to cover.
However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.
Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of “short availability utilization”. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “GME X’mas special”.
 
 With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.
 https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) – so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.
  
 As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun’21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.
The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs.
I understand the short-thesis – I really do.
Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.
The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent
guidance seems to suggest otherwise.
I can personally find NO REASON to be short this stock anymore at least for the next 7 months, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4’21 and decent outlook for Q1’22) and then we will have a dividend payment in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).
From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.
The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.
But now, its time for a reversal.
   
 The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)
$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul’21).
The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been ~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.
So far, YTD Q3’21, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.
  An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!
That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.
The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July – so we have some time. But let’s face it, everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.
Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. An earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks.
Company has bought back shares previously – and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so I wouldn’t put a potential stock buyback past the company.
All in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen ~15% over the last few weeks, it’s quite a surprise that the stock hasn’t rallied much more.
More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).
A question from the “Growth Bros”: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?
A common question – and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.
  But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light. So, 2 points worth noting:
1. Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is ‘reinvestment’. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
   2. Reasonably capex-light business: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.
  Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

 - R&amp;D – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and
  - Capex - including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase
 In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their ‘investment phase’, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.
So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so, why hasn’t
  the share price gone up then?
Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.
Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20’s performance) as well.
Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.
  Hedge Funds’ share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 – when performance improved dramatically.
 
 Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.
Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.
So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn’t stock kept pace?
Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.
   Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. More on valuation at the end.
The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION! Folks believe that this stock is manipulated by Market Makers (MMs) who are often option sellers on $HIMX. Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed.
With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it’s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!
Q3 Earnings
Now – let’s discuss the recent earnings
Q3’21 revenue: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)
Q3’21 gross margin: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2’21 and vs 22.3% in Q3’20 (guidance was 50.5-52%) Q3’21 EBITDA: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here! Q3’21 Levered FCF of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.
  The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.
 
 Charts for annual performance incl LTM Sep’21 and YTD Sep’21 are shown below:
 So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.
 
 GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market
 Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.
Why was the market waiting on guidance? Because indications were that:
(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,
(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline) (c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)
 Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure......or at least that’s what the shorts were betting on.
Before I go into $HIMX’s guidance, let’s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) – which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4
+
its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:
 - Q4’21 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and
  - Q4’21 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.
 This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) – so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.
But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:
 - Q4 revenue would INCREASE by +4% to +8% q-o-q,
  - Gross margin: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)
  - Q4 IFRS EPS (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs
 prior year (Q4’20) of $0.195 → i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!
  - Q4 non IFRS EPS (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)
 Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!
To be fair, the margin decrease is more of a dilutionary effect than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.
“It’s simple math”, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX’s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.
 
 However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact.
But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through. In other words – earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.
This level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)
Mr. Lopez’s question is below:
 The answer to this question was pretty much that
a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 – FY19), and
   b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’.
  Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “again and
 again and again” (yes, 3 again’s specifically mentioned) – and notes that guidance this time is no different.
In fact, if you look at $HIMX’s historical guidance, you will see that the company has consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1’17) – and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.
 
 So yes – as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this “again and again and again”!!! Let’s just say management is highly credible.
Top line guidance by segment:
- Large DDIC – to GROW by high single digit q-o-q helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.
- Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC (overall) – GROW low teens q-o-q and &gt;50% yoy By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:
   - Smartphones -&gt; GROW high teens q-o-q &amp; &gt;30% yoy
 - Tablet -&gt; flat q-o-q, and
   - Automotive -&gt; GROW double-digit q-o-q and &gt;100% yoy. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX’s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.
 Interestingly within the Smartphone segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features”.
Also, and more importantly “successful engagements with some key customers have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches”. i.e. winning more market share.
Lots to like here.
Automotive is $HIMX’s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share. Company notes that the “increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle
is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle”.
Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need
 to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.
 
 As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC segment, which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.
This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application (industrial application, from what I gather) – which is on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures).
 In addition, $HIMX also notes that the number of awarded projects in this segment is growing rapidly, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical...”to name a few”. Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.
$HIMX also notes “within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company’s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from cloud service providers who look for secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services”. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.
$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year. This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future.
 
 VALUATION &amp; Conclusion
The chart below compares Himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.
However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers – with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.
The average fair value on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 – representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.
  As for transaction comps, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents 21x EV/EBITDA – which if applied to $HIMX, gives a FV of $54/share or +370% upside!
Is $54/share possible here? Absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a few steps ahead of competition with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its
 existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.
We haven’t even discussed $HIMX’s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long- term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).
But I’d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game”, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.
Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary – although, that is probably some time away.
For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.
Let’s squeeze this one dry. GME X’mas special.

Short interest spiked way Q earnings expectation bad outlook As October share short float equates short float NASDAQ note day cover October The amount stock shorted increased going earnings last week th November This mean highly likely today HIMX stock shorted I believe limit shorting In word little available short I found data provider show short utilization close meaning clear inability short stock anymore A big short squeeze coming This GME X ma special Cant confirm unconfirmed hearsay hearing much short position held Asian hedge fund could get squeezed nicely stock start shooting already shot last couple week Disclosure I stock Jan Mar call Position screenshot transparency purpose I exposure share share option contract across Jan Mar What HIMX Products Before go recent earnings opportunity question quick snippet Himax HIMX fable integrated chip IC design house specializing field Display Driver DDICs These DDICs used make panel turn used Large sized DDICs gt TVs Notebooks Monitors etc Small amp Mid sized DDICs gt Smartphones Tablets Displays Automotive Vehicles etc In addition DDICs HIMX also non DDIC business includes following High end Timing Controller improves

especially within broader Internet Things IoT area Liquid Cystal Silicon LCoS microdisplays usage AR VR glass Automotive Head Displays HUD Holographic Displays etc Other product Wafer Level Optics WLO D sensing facial recognition technology phone etc As summary picture give idea product used Revenue segment Revenue split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC Smartphone Android Tablets division roughly Automotive OEM representing revenue aa Last Twelve Month LTM basis Non driver ICs However HIMX seen significant growth Automotive OEMs expects segment represent largest segment going forward The Q revenue split segment shown Competitors Market Shares In Q presentation available HIMX note th largest DDIC player globally market share behind Novatek Samsung also customer LX Semicon SiliconWorks You may also familiar listed business smaller DDIC contribution revenue including FocalTech Synaptics Sitronix Mediatek As market share individual segment Q HIMX market share Large DDIC Smartphones Tablets note HIMX gt market share Android non iOS tablet quoted across tablet including Apple Automotive OEM So happening recently Himax excellent year HIMX demand consumer electronics spiked also company anticipated significant shortage foundry capacity impacting semiconductor Company realized quite early even covid significant foundry capacity shortage especially specific mature node product HIMX management foresaw historical lack investment mature node combined increasing demand product well new product use exactly mature node would result significant shortage foundry capacity So last year HIMX cosied foundry partner entered long term contract secure additional supply When covid hit early corporates cancelled product order extra foundry capacity came market initially HIMX capitalized opportunity secure even foundry supply Covid blessing disguise HIMX able secure supply enter much better deal significant increase demand end product meant HIMX found sweet spot This gamble paid well demand spiked When many DDIC provider caught pant due lack sufficient foundry supply especially non Taiwanese player HIMX walked full jump suit colourful one This allowed take decent amount market share course last year The graph show significant jump market share Smartphone Tablets segment especially FY So increase demand management foresaw HIMX management expected see demand increasing higher end version existing product consumer electronics broadly speaking also saw increasing adoption HQ screen new area like Internet Things IoT Automotive vehicle In addition modernisation electrification vehicle EV would boost requirement screen At time slightly unrelated worth mentioning also noted increase adoption would also require chip reduce power consumption significantly This resulted business working option come related product form part Non Driver IC business lot growth potential In word business invested potential diversification away DDICs related product On top increasing demand higher end existing product screen adoption area electrification vehicle etc management also noted unrelated application G high performance computing HPC would also require component use mature node DDIC business used In word HIMX management foresaw increasing demand would come supply shortage started preparing time ago I guess show management excellent Isn adding long term supply time demand spiked risky Will demand persist As mentioned earlier HIMX added market share combination volume existing client well adding new client However HIMX smart entered deal panel maker customer well leading end customer e consumer electronics automotive OEM brand In word increase supply HIMX taking matched increase demand HIMX satisfying demand HIMX taken prepayment deposit customer wanted secure supply component product HIMX foreseeable future So yes demand persist management said demand persist much given clear capacity shortage still experienced industry HIMX inability fulfil order due capacity shortage Now background Supply secured along said demand SHORT SQUEEZE Before going Q result released Thursday th November probably worth mentioning I believe HIMX clear Short Squeeze candidate To every possibility GME round dear friend said given timing opportunity even called GME X ma special So I mention SHORT SQUEEZE well according data th October short interest around share representing float Bloomberg noting day cover However data October I believe short interest increased going earnings Q earnings th November meaning currently short interest likely gt float Lack stock availability mean gt short availability utilization A big short squeeze coming This GME X ma special With earnings way good result much better expected guidance literally good reason anyone short stock near term let alone fact little availability short anyway give stats borrow availability see chart Currently show k borrow availability IBKR whole lot considering daily volume average around million As see stock borrow availability quite low We similar level limited availability Jun stock jumped end May high gt intraday th June The increase stock price squeezed short significantly saw stock rally cool odd I think see shortly uncertainty removed could rally much much higher previous high I understand short thesis I really Potential sale decline end consumer demand certain product falling alongside margin pressure foundry HIMX supplier raise price could created perfect doomsday scenario putting huge pressure stock price That good fair thesis The whole short thesis predicated potential reversal performance recent guidance seems suggest otherwise I personally find NO REASON short stock anymore least next month especially given solid guidance We pretty much clarity next quarter full guidance Q decent outlook Q dividend payment July record date usually Jun From I hear mind unconfirmed hearsay much short position held Asian hedge fund increasing short position ahead earnings The short interest jumped share th June dividend record date th October The share price turn collapsed closing price th June low th October But time reversal The Dividend maybe even stock buyback HIMX historically paid EPS dividend For FY HIMX paid IFRS fully diluted EPS dividend paid Jul The average payout since FY FY Fair assume payout IFRS fully diluted EPS continues year So far YTD Q IFRS fully diluted EPS Company recently gave Q guidance Assuming mid point guidance arrive potential fully diluted EPS FY share An payout mean dividend share represents dividend yield given share price today That dear friend crazy cost short The dividend usually declared June paid July time But let face everyone math long institution jump band wagon Now course assuming fund distributed dividend An earlier distribution also likely potentially share buyback Company bought back share previously honest share look ridiculously cheap given performance I put potential stock buyback past company All significant upward pressure price although share already risen last week quite surprise stock rallied much More valuation later end write A question Growth Bros paying dividend mean business grow A common question I get Not many dividend paying business grow like HIMX Understandable But note HIMX DDIC peer fable design house meaning capex light So point worth noting Dividend based EPS net R amp D expense gt reinvestment R amp D spent new product innovation upgrade mostly Reasonably capex light business HIMX fable involve significant amount capex Also HIMX invested significantly R amp D capex FY FY given expectation potential surge demand product Specifically focussed developing new product line upgrading existing product R amp D including spend upgrade existing product line move towards higher quality product range like product K K TVs well focus developing new product non DDIC business Capex including payment secure additional foundry capacity well expansion existing production capability existing product including land purchase In word year pain FY FY effectively investment phase HIMX shareholder enjoying fruit hard earned labour today So performance great massive shareholder distribution coming share price gone Well question still haunt longs name Performance valuation side company reinstated dividend FY performance well Perhaps answer stock predominantly owned traded retail investor However changing hedge fund institution getting involved The chart show change time Hedge Funds share increased outstanding stock today institutional incl mutual fund ownership increased FY today Note much increase came FY FY performance improved dramatically Much attributed company actively marketing attending conference pitching institution The institutional HF participation set increase opinion Also note founder CEO family owns company So performance getting better institutional ownership improving stock kept pace Well firstly stock climbed significantly since jumped mere share share today The high stock th June price since declined despite performance improving Although share price increased performance much better valuation today still significantly cheaper v peer More valuation end The belief amongst longs MANIPULATION Folks believe stock manipulated Market Makers MMs often option seller HIMX Retail trade option much actively stock giving incentive MMs keep stock price depressed With performance outlook well potential stockholder distribution divi stock buyback side time TAKE BACK CONTROL Q Earnings Now let discus recent earnings Q revenue yoy q q guidance q q Q gross margin v Q v Q guidance Q EBITDA x yoy q q impact operating leverage clearly visible Q Levered FCF bringing YTD FCF The chart show quarterly performance clearly Charts annual performance incl LTM Sep YTD Sep shown So Q result came higher end guidance Excellent GUIDANCE positively surprising market Performance going decent However Q guidance market eagerly waiting short keeping close eye Why market waiting guidance Because indication consumer demand TV smartphones fading b panel maker feeling pain e HIMX customer seeing pricing decline c foundry raising price e HIMX supplier raising price Worries around cost increase fading demand would mean mix topline AND margin pressure least short betting Before I go HIMX guidance let say market following panel maker HIMX customer guiding lower volume Q nearest largest competitor Novatek released guidance Thursday th Nov morning stating Q revenue would decline q q Q gross margin would decline registered Q This Novatek guidance better market feared Novatek stock rose Taiwan waiting HIMX report something similar But HIMX KILLED IT Why It reported Q revenue would INCREASE q q Gross margin would fall around reported Q Q IFRS EPS dividend based YTD already v prior year Q e forecast grow roughly x Q non IFRS EPS adjusted non recurring item SBC v prior year Q x roughly Yes margin marginally e foundry raising price one expected growth revenue coming To fair margin decrease dilutionary effect cost increase impact HIMX passing price increase customer anyway It simple math CEO explained call He noted original foundry cost HIMX selling price gt gross margin would However foundry raised price HIMX passed customer selling price increased margin would gt dilutionary impact rather pure profitability impact But I said earlier one expected growth revenue coming In word earnings good guidance took market surprise This level surprise best encapsulated question Vertical Group analyst Jon Lopez analyst SELL rating HIMX target expectation bad Q perhaps Mr Lopez question The answer question pretty much HIMX giving lot lower end business price competition rampant return higher end HQ business get industry recognition company aggressively investing product suite upgrade FY FY b HIMX building relationship top tier brand directly rather going panel maker making demand product defensive Management also alluded proven sale performance v guidance yes specifically mentioned note guidance time different In fact look HIMX historical guidance see company consistently delivered earnings within guidance least last quarter since Q case either higher end guidance beat altogether So yes CEO Jordan Wu note company history delivering beating guidance shown Let say management highly credible Top line guidance segment Large DDIC GROW high single digit q q helped growth notebook monitor although TV sale drop slightly due softer end market However HIMX remains positive large DDIC given shortage wafer capacity Small amp Mid sized DDIC overall GROW low teen q q gt yoy By sub segment within small amp mid sized DDIC Smartphones gt GROW high teen q q amp gt yoy Tablet gt flat q q Automotive gt GROW double digit q q gt yoy Stalled capacity restricting HIMX ability meet customer demand significant shortage still persists Interestingly within Smartphone segment HIMX mkt share company note undertaking new design development supporting higher frame rate ultra slim bezel higher resolution feature Also importantly successful engagement key customer achieved Q customer indicating interest next launch e winning market share Lots like Automotive HIMX highest growth area hold growing market share Company note increase number size sophistication display inside vehicle evolving rapid rate indicating much DDIC demand per vehicle Not going write extract Q earnings tell everything need know show positive future business within segment As noted earlier HIMX also non DDIC segment expected decline Q expected significant growth contributor onwards higher margin This segment includes component AR VR amp IoT application This longer term area worth watching adoption increase last quarter HIMX reported design win top tier name mainstream application industrial application I gather track enter mass production Q result visible figure In addition HIMX also note number awarded project segment growing rapidly covering broad range application including notebook home appliance utility meter automotive battery surveillance camera panoramic video conferencing medical name Some application already slated mass production end year meaning see benefit coming HIMX also note within year since HIMX started sampling company WiseEye solution also drawn much attention cloud service provider look secure low power edge AI device help collect big data cloud based service This open new market frontier area like smart city smart office healthcare agriculture retail factory automation HIMX anticipates design win award growing volume shipment starting next year This segment drive lot growth business future VALUATION amp Conclusion The chart compare Himax valuation v peer note competitor division apart DDIC make direct comp However metric LTM basis HIMX screen much cheaper v peer minimum upside Upside using traded comparables representing fair value share v today The average fair value traded comparables HIMX share representing upside v current share price As transaction comp South Korean DDIC business Magnachip MX US currently subject takeover offer Chinese private equity Wise Road Capital share US government trying stop This offer represents x EV EBITDA applied HIMX give FV share upside Is share possible Absolutely business growing nearest competitor Novatek actually declining This business invested future step ahead competition respect developing new product well upgrading existing product suite building direct relationship end brand We even discussed HIMX potential growth AR VR even mid long term plan nothing imminent next year But I say foot door already mean remain relevant game whether game physical digital even METAVERSE Yes

Again, full credit to YieldFanatic as I’m too retarded to do a DD like this one. But to be fair I tried to tell you retards about HIMAX a while back. YieldFanatic’s DD is more on the spectrum than mine though;

7th November 2021
Welcome to the Yield Fanatic’s Trade Idea series. This write up is on the Taiwanese
semiconductor business, Himax. The shares are listed on NASDAQ and the ticker is $HIMX.
The date of write up is 7th November 2021 – as I write this, $HIMX’s current share price is $11.45 and market cap is roughly $2.0 billion. Note that this isn’t part of the deep dive series like I mostly present but rather a unique tactical trade idea given where this company trades at the moment.
But as always, before we start, the disclaimer. A few points worth noting:
Firstly, this is not investment advice nor is it a recommendation to buy or sell any security. This is just the Yield Fanatic’s opinion of the stock in question. If you wish to seek advice, please do so from an accredited financial advisor, which the Yield Fanatic is not.
Secondly, the opinion shown in this presentation is based on Yield’s read of things. Your view may be different based on your read of things, but it is the difference in views and opinion that makes a market.
The aim of this write up and recording is to give you an unbiased VIEW of the opportunity in question. The aim is to give you all the data that you need to make your own decision.
And finally, the Yield Fanatic does have a position in Himax at present and so, the opinions expressed here may be biased. This is a name that I have traded in the past and which I will continually trade in and out of.
To be clear, the Yield Fanatic does reserve to trade or invest in the name, subject to views and valuation at that specific point in time.
   Finally and before we start, note that this was originally written up for the purpose of posting on Reddit, so the tone may seem different to the one normally adopted on my other pieces of work.
 $HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present. TLDR:
 1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company – trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!
 The shares are cheap in a more “normal” S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as stupid cheap with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation
 2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.
3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4’21 and even Q1’22, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have consistently delivered

 results “to guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether.
 4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year – representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.
 5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.
  ..and now for the fun bit:
 6. Potential for a significant short squeeze. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were ~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to ~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.
 The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short – and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “GME X’mas special”.
7. Cant confirm this (unconfirmed hearsay) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up..... and it has already shot up ~15% last couple of weeks.
  Disclosure: I own stock + Jan’22 and Mar’22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan’22 and $10 Mar’22).
 
 What does $HIMX do? Products?
 Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here’s a quick snippet of what Himax does:
$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make ‘panels’ which are, in turn, used in:
 - Large sized DDICs -&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc
 - Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs -&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc
   In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:
- High end Timing Controller which improves power efficiency in displays
   - WiseEye ultra power AI --&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ AI and ML to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet
 of Things (IoT) area.
 
  - Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays – with usage in AR/VR glasses, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), Holographic Displays, etc.
 
- Other products in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)
  As a summary – the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:
 
Revenue by segment:
Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) – with Automotive OEM representing ~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs ~12.5%.
  However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.
The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.
  
 Competitors and Market Shares:
In the Q3’21 presentation (available here), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).
You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.
As for market share by the individual segments, as of Q3’21, $HIMX’s market shares were:
   - Large DDIC: 10.5%
  - Smartphones: 10.4%
 - Tablets: 37.7% but note that $HIMX has &gt; 60% market share of Android / non iOS tablets – the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.
   - Automotive OEM: 32.8%
  So, what has been happening recently with Himax?
2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.
Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products.
 
 $HIMX management foresaw that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes”, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.
When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially.... and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.
Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX
 found itself in a very sweet spot.
This gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked. When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players), $HIMX walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!
This allowed it to take a decent amount of market share over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.
So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?
$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) .....but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like Internet of Things (IoT) and Automotive/vehicles.
In addition, the modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV) would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.
   
 On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such 5G and high performance computing (HPC) – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its DDIC business used.
In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for, some time ago.
I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.
Isn’t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?
As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 – this is from a combination of
  more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.
However, $HIMX was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand.... and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.
$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.
So yes, for now – the demand will persist, and as management has said, this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage.
Now, that’s the background. Supply secured along with said demand.
SHORT SQUEEZE
Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear Short Squeeze candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 – and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the “GME X’mas special”.
So, why do I mention a ‘SHORT SQUEEZE’ – well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest
  is around 24.7m shares, representing ~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting ~11 days to cover.
However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.
Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of “short availability utilization”. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “GME X’mas special”.
 
 With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.
 https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) – so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.
  
 As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun’21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.
The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs.
I understand the short-thesis – I really do.
Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.
The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent
guidance seems to suggest otherwise.
I can personally find NO REASON to be short this stock anymore at least for the next 7 months, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4’21 and decent outlook for Q1’22) and then we will have a dividend payment in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).
From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.
The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.
But now, its time for a reversal.
   
 The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)
$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul’21).
The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been ~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.
So far, YTD Q3’21, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.
  An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!
That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.
The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July – so we have some time. But let’s face it, everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.
Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. An earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks.
Company has bought back shares previously – and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so I wouldn’t put a potential stock buyback past the company.
All in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen ~15% over the last few weeks, it’s quite a surprise that the stock hasn’t rallied much more.
More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).
A question from the “Growth Bros”: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?
A common question – and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.
  But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light. So, 2 points worth noting:
1. Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is ‘reinvestment’. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
   2. Reasonably capex-light business: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.
  Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

 - R&amp;D – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and
  - Capex - including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase
 In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their ‘investment phase’, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.
So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so, why hasn’t
  the share price gone up then?
Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.
Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20’s performance) as well.
Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.
  Hedge Funds’ share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 – when performance improved dramatically.
 
 Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.
Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.
So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn’t stock kept pace?
Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.
   Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. More on valuation at the end.
The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION! Folks believe that this stock is manipulated by Market Makers (MMs) who are often option sellers on $HIMX. Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed.
With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it’s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!
Q3 Earnings
Now – let’s discuss the recent earnings
Q3’21 revenue: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)
Q3’21 gross margin: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2’21 and vs 22.3% in Q3’20 (guidance was 50.5-52%) Q3’21 EBITDA: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here! Q3’21 Levered FCF of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.
  The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.
 
 Charts for annual performance incl LTM Sep’21 and YTD Sep’21 are shown below:
 So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.
 
 GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market
 Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.
Why was the market waiting on guidance? Because indications were that:
(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,
(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline) (c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)
 Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure......or at least that’s what the shorts were betting on.
Before I go into $HIMX’s guidance, let’s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) – which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4
+
its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:
 - Q4’21 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and
  - Q4’21 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.
 This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) – so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.
But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:
 - Q4 revenue would INCREASE by +4% to +8% q-o-q,
  - Gross margin: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)
  - Q4 IFRS EPS (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs
 prior year (Q4’20) of $0.195 → i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!
  - Q4 non IFRS EPS (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)
 Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!
To be fair, the margin decrease is more of a dilutionary effect than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.
“It’s simple math”, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX’s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.
 
 However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact.
But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through. In other words – earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.
This level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)
Mr. Lopez’s question is below:
 The answer to this question was pretty much that
a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 – FY19), and
   b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’.
  Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “again and
 again and again” (yes, 3 again’s specifically mentioned) – and notes that guidance this time is no different.
In fact, if you look at $HIMX’s historical guidance, you will see that the company has consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1’17) – and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.
 
 So yes – as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this “again and again and again”!!! Let’s just say management is highly credible.
Top line guidance by segment:
- Large DDIC – to GROW by high single digit q-o-q helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.
- Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC (overall) – GROW low teens q-o-q and &gt;50% yoy By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:
   - Smartphones -&gt; GROW high teens q-o-q &amp; &gt;30% yoy
 - Tablet -&gt; flat q-o-q, and
   - Automotive -&gt; GROW double-digit q-o-q and &gt;100% yoy. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX’s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.
 Interestingly within the Smartphone segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features”.
Also, and more importantly “successful engagements with some key customers have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches”. i.e. winning more market share.
Lots to like here.
Automotive is $HIMX’s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share. Company notes that the “increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle
is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle”.
Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need
 to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.
 
 As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC segment, which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.
This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application (industrial application, from what I gather) – which is on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures).
 In addition, $HIMX also notes that the number of awarded projects in this segment is growing rapidly, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical...”to name a few”. Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.
$HIMX also notes “within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company’s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from cloud service providers who look for secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services”. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.
$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year. This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future.
 
 VALUATION &amp; Conclusion
The chart below compares Himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.
However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers – with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.
The average fair value on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 – representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.
  As for transaction comps, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents 21x EV/EBITDA – which if applied to $HIMX, gives a FV of $54/share or +370% upside!
Is $54/share possible here? Absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a few steps ahead of competition with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its
 existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.
We haven’t even discussed $HIMX’s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long- term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).
But I’d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game”, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.
Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary – although, that is probably some time away.
For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.
Let’s squeeze this one dry. GME X’mas special.

7th November 2021
Welcome to the Yield Fanatic’s Trade Idea series. This write up is on the Taiwanese
semiconductor business, Himax. The shares are listed on NASDAQ and the ticker is $HIMX.
The date of write up is 7th November 2021 – as I write this, $HIMX’s current share price is $11.45 and market cap is roughly $2.0 billion. Note that this isn’t part of the deep dive series like I mostly present but rather a unique tactical trade idea given where this company trades at the moment.
But as always, before we start, the disclaimer. A few points worth noting:
Firstly, this is not investment advice nor is it a recommendation to buy or sell any security. This is just the Yield Fanatic’s opinion of the stock in question. If you wish to seek advice, please do so from an accredited financial advisor, which the Yield Fanatic is not.
Secondly, the opinion shown in this presentation is based on Yield’s read of things. Your view may be different based on your read of things, but it is the difference in views and opinion that makes a market.
The aim of this write up and recording is to give you an unbiased VIEW of the opportunity in question. The aim is to give you all the data that you need to make your own decision.
And finally, the Yield Fanatic does have a position in Himax at present and so, the opinions expressed here may be biased. This is a name that I have traded in the past and which I will continually trade in and out of.
To be clear, the Yield Fanatic does reserve to trade or invest in the name, subject to views and valuation at that specific point in time.
   Finally and before we start, note that this was originally written up for the purpose of posting on Reddit, so the tone may seem different to the one normally adopted on my other pieces of work.
 $HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present. TLDR:
 1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company – trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!
 The shares are cheap in a more “normal” S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as stupid cheap with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation
 2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.
3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4’21 and even Q1’22, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have consistently delivered

 results “to guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether.
 4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year – representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.
 5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.
  ..and now for the fun bit:
 6. Potential for a significant short squeeze. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were ~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to ~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.
 The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short – and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “GME X’mas special”.
7. Cant confirm this (unconfirmed hearsay) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up..... and it has already shot up ~15% last couple of weeks.
  Disclosure: I own stock + Jan’22 and Mar’22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan’22 and $10 Mar’22).
 
 What does $HIMX do? Products?
 Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here’s a quick snippet of what Himax does:
$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make ‘panels’ which are, in turn, used in:
 - Large sized DDICs -&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc
 - Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs -&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc
   In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:
- High end Timing Controller which improves power efficiency in displays
   - WiseEye ultra power AI --&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ AI and ML to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet
 of Things (IoT) area.
 
  - Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays – with usage in AR/VR glasses, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), Holographic Displays, etc.
 
- Other products in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)
  As a summary – the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:
 
Revenue by segment:
Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) – with Automotive OEM representing ~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs ~12.5%.
  However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.
The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.
  
 Competitors and Market Shares:
In the Q3’21 presentation (available here), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).
You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.
As for market share by the individual segments, as of Q3’21, $HIMX’s market shares were:
   - Large DDIC: 10.5%
  - Smartphones: 10.4%
 - Tablets: 37.7% but note that $HIMX has &gt; 60% market share of Android / non iOS tablets – the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.
   - Automotive OEM: 32.8%
  So, what has been happening recently with Himax?
2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.
Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products.
 
 $HIMX management foresaw that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes”, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.
When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially.... and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.
Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX
 found itself in a very sweet spot.
This gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked. When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players), $HIMX walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!
This allowed it to take a decent amount of market share over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.
So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?
$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) .....but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like Internet of Things (IoT) and Automotive/vehicles.
In addition, the modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV) would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.
   
 On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such 5G and high performance computing (HPC) – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its DDIC business used.
In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for, some time ago.
I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.
Isn’t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?
As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 – this is from a combination of
  more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.
However, $HIMX was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand.... and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.
$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.
So yes, for now – the demand will persist, and as management has said, this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage.
Now, that’s the background. Supply secured along with said demand.
SHORT SQUEEZE
Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear Short Squeeze candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 – and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the “GME X’mas special”.
So, why do I mention a ‘SHORT SQUEEZE’ – well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest
  is around 24.7m shares, representing ~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting ~11 days to cover.
However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.
Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of “short availability utilization”. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “GME X’mas special”.
 
 With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.
 https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) – so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.
  
 As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun’21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.
The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs.
I understand the short-thesis – I really do.
Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.
The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent
guidance seems to suggest otherwise.
I can personally find NO REASON to be short this stock anymore at least for the next 7 months, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4’21 and decent outlook for Q1’22) and then we will have a dividend payment in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).
From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.
The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.
But now, its time for a reversal.
   
 The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)
$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul’21).
The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been ~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.
So far, YTD Q3’21, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.
  An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!
That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.
The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July – so we have some time. But let’s face it, everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.
Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. An earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks.
Company has bought back shares previously – and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so I wouldn’t put a potential stock buyback past the company.
All in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen ~15% over the last few weeks, it’s quite a surprise that the stock hasn’t rallied much more.
More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).
A question from the “Growth Bros”: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?
A common question – and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.
  But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light. So, 2 points worth noting:
1. Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is ‘reinvestment’. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
   2. Reasonably capex-light business: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.
  Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

 - R&amp;D – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and
  - Capex - including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase
 In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their ‘investment phase’, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.
So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so, why hasn’t
  the share price gone up then?
Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.
Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20’s performance) as well.
Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.
  Hedge Funds’ share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 – when performance improved dramatically.
 
 Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.
Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.
So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn’t stock kept pace?
Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.
   Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. More on valuation at the end.
The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION! Folks believe that this stock is manipulated by Market Makers (MMs) who are often option sellers on $HIMX. Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed.
With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it’s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!
Q3 Earnings
Now – let’s discuss the recent earnings
Q3’21 revenue: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)
Q3’21 gross margin: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2’21 and vs 22.3% in Q3’20 (guidance was 50.5-52%) Q3’21 EBITDA: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here! Q3’21 Levered FCF of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.
  The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.
 
 Charts for annual performance incl LTM Sep’21 and YTD Sep’21 are shown below:
 So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.
 
 GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market
 Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.
Why was the market waiting on guidance? Because indications were that:
(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,
(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline) (c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)
 Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure......or at least that’s what the shorts were betting on.
Before I go into $HIMX’s guidance, let’s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) – which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4
+
its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:
 - Q4’21 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and
  - Q4’21 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.
 This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) – so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.
But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:
 - Q4 revenue would INCREASE by +4% to +8% q-o-q,
  - Gross margin: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)
  - Q4 IFRS EPS (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs
 prior year (Q4’20) of $0.195 → i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!
  - Q4 non IFRS EPS (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)
 Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!
To be fair, the margin decrease is more of a dilutionary effect than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.
“It’s simple math”, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX’s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.
 
 However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact.
But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through. In other words – earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.
This level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)
Mr. Lopez’s question is below:
 The answer to this question was pretty much that
a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 – FY19), and
   b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’.
  Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “again and
 again and again” (yes, 3 again’s specifically mentioned) – and notes that guidance this time is no different.
In fact, if you look at $HIMX’s historical guidance, you will see that the company has consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1’17) – and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.
 
 So yes – as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this “again and again and again”!!! Let’s just say management is highly credible.
Top line guidance by segment:
- Large DDIC – to GROW by high single digit q-o-q helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.
- Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC (overall) – GROW low teens q-o-q and &gt;50% yoy By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:
   - Smartphones -&gt; GROW high teens q-o-q &amp; &gt;30% yoy
 - Tablet -&gt; flat q-o-q, and
   - Automotive -&gt; GROW double-digit q-o-q and &gt;100% yoy. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX’s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.
 Interestingly within the Smartphone segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features”.
Also, and more importantly “successful engagements with some key customers have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches”. i.e. winning more market share.
Lots to like here.
Automotive is $HIMX’s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share. Company notes that the “increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle
is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle”.
Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need
 to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.
 
 As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC segment, which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.
This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application (industrial application, from what I gather) – which is on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures).
 In addition, $HIMX also notes that the number of awarded projects in this segment is growing rapidly, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical...”to name a few”. Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.
$HIMX also notes “within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company’s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from cloud service providers who look for secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services”. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.
$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year. This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future.
 
 VALUATION &amp; Conclusion
The chart below compares Himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.
However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers – with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.
The average fair value on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 – representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.
  As for transaction comps, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents 21x EV/EBITDA – which if applied to $HIMX, gives a FV of $54/share or +370% upside!
Is $54/share possible here? Absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a few steps ahead of competition with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its
 existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.
We haven’t even discussed $HIMX’s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long- term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).
But I’d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game”, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.
Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary – although, that is probably some time away.
For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.
Let’s squeeze this one dry. GME X’mas special.

7th November 2021
Welcome to the Yield Fanatic’s Trade Idea series. This write up is on the Taiwanese
semiconductor business, Himax. The shares are listed on NASDAQ and the ticker is $HIMX.
The date of write up is 7th November 2021 – as I write this, $HIMX’s current share price is $11.45 and market cap is roughly $2.0 billion. Note that this isn’t part of the deep dive series like I mostly present but rather a unique tactical trade idea given where this company trades at the moment.
But as always, before we start, the disclaimer. A few points worth noting:
Firstly, this is not investment advice nor is it a recommendation to buy or sell any security. This is just the Yield Fanatic’s opinion of the stock in question. If you wish to seek advice, please do so from an accredited financial advisor, which the Yield Fanatic is not.
Secondly, the opinion shown in this presentation is based on Yield’s read of things. Your view may be different based on your read of things, but it is the difference in views and opinion that makes a market.
The aim of this write up and recording is to give you an unbiased VIEW of the opportunity in question. The aim is to give you all the data that you need to make your own decision.
And finally, the Yield Fanatic does have a position in Himax at present and so, the opinions expressed here may be biased. This is a name that I have traded in the past and which I will continually trade in and out of.
To be clear, the Yield Fanatic does reserve to trade or invest in the name, subject to views and valuation at that specific point in time.
   Finally and before we start, note that this was originally written up for the purpose of posting on Reddit, so the tone may seem different to the one normally adopted on my other pieces of work.
 $HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present. TLDR:
 1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company – trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!
 The shares are cheap in a more “normal” S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as stupid cheap with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation
 2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.
3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4’21 and even Q1’22, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have consistently delivered

 results “to guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether.
 4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year – representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.
 5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.
  ..and now for the fun bit:
 6. Potential for a significant short squeeze. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were ~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to ~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.
 The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short – and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “GME X’mas special”.
7. Cant confirm this (unconfirmed hearsay) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up..... and it has already shot up ~15% last couple of weeks.
  Disclosure: I own stock + Jan’22 and Mar’22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan’22 and $10 Mar’22).
 
 What does $HIMX do? Products?
 Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here’s a quick snippet of what Himax does:
$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make ‘panels’ which are, in turn, used in:
 - Large sized DDICs -&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc
 - Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs -&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc
   In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:
- High end Timing Controller which improves power efficiency in displays
   - WiseEye ultra power AI --&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ AI and ML to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet
 of Things (IoT) area.
 
  - Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays – with usage in AR/VR glasses, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), Holographic Displays, etc.
 
- Other products in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)
  As a summary – the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:
 
Revenue by segment:
Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) – with Automotive OEM representing ~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs ~12.5%.
  However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.
The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.
  
 Competitors and Market Shares:
In the Q3’21 presentation (available here), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).
You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.
As for market share by the individual segments, as of Q3’21, $HIMX’s market shares were:
   - Large DDIC: 10.5%
  - Smartphones: 10.4%
 - Tablets: 37.7% but note that $HIMX has &gt; 60% market share of Android / non iOS tablets – the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.
   - Automotive OEM: 32.8%
  So, what has been happening recently with Himax?
2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.
Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products.
 
 $HIMX management foresaw that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes”, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.
When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially.... and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.
Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX
 found itself in a very sweet spot.
This gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked. When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players), $HIMX walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!
This allowed it to take a decent amount of market share over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.
So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?
$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) .....but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like Internet of Things (IoT) and Automotive/vehicles.
In addition, the modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV) would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.
   
 On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such 5G and high performance computing (HPC) – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its DDIC business used.
In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for, some time ago.
I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.
Isn’t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?
As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 – this is from a combination of
  more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.
However, $HIMX was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand.... and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.
$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.
So yes, for now – the demand will persist, and as management has said, this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage.
Now, that’s the background. Supply secured along with said demand.
SHORT SQUEEZE
Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear Short Squeeze candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 – and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the “GME X’mas special”.
So, why do I mention a ‘SHORT SQUEEZE’ – well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest
  is around 24.7m shares, representing ~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting ~11 days to cover.
However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.
Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of “short availability utilization”. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “GME X’mas special”.
 
 With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.
 https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) – so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.
  
 As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun’21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.
The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs.
I understand the short-thesis – I really do.
Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.
The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent
guidance seems to suggest otherwise.
I can personally find NO REASON to be short this stock anymore at least for the next 7 months, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4’21 and decent outlook for Q1’22) and then we will have a dividend payment in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).
From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.
The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.
But now, its time for a reversal.
   
 The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)
$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul’21).
The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been ~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.
So far, YTD Q3’21, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.
  An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!
That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.
The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July – so we have some time. But let’s face it, everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.
Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. An earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks.
Company has bought back shares previously – and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so I wouldn’t put a potential stock buyback past the company.
All in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen ~15% over the last few weeks, it’s quite a surprise that the stock hasn’t rallied much more.
More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).
A question from the “Growth Bros”: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?
A common question – and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.
  But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light. So, 2 points worth noting:
1. Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is ‘reinvestment’. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
   2. Reasonably capex-light business: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.
  Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

 - R&amp;D – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and
  - Capex - including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase
 In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their ‘investment phase’, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.
So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so, why hasn’t
  the share price gone up then?
Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.
Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20’s performance) as well.
Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.
  Hedge Funds’ share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 – when performance improved dramatically.
 
 Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.
Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.
So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn’t stock kept pace?
Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.
   Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. More on valuation at the end.
The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION! Folks believe that this stock is manipulated by Market Makers (MMs) who are often option sellers on $HIMX. Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed.
With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it’s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!
Q3 Earnings
Now – let’s discuss the recent earnings
Q3’21 revenue: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)
Q3’21 gross margin: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2’21 and vs 22.3% in Q3’20 (guidance was 50.5-52%) Q3’21 EBITDA: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here! Q3’21 Levered FCF of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.
  The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.
 
 Charts for annual performance incl LTM Sep’21 and YTD Sep’21 are shown below:
 So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.
 
 GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market
 Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.
Why was the market waiting on guidance? Because indications were that:
(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,
(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline) (c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)
 Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure......or at least that’s what the shorts were betting on.
Before I go into $HIMX’s guidance, let’s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) – which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4
+
its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:
 - Q4’21 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and
  - Q4’21 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.
 This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) – so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.
But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:
 - Q4 revenue would INCREASE by +4% to +8% q-o-q,
  - Gross margin: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)
  - Q4 IFRS EPS (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs
 prior year (Q4’20) of $0.195 → i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!
  - Q4 non IFRS EPS (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)
 Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!
To be fair, the margin decrease is more of a dilutionary effect than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.
“It’s simple math”, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX’s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.
 
 However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact.
But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through. In other words – earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.
This level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)
Mr. Lopez’s question is below:
 The answer to this question was pretty much that
a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 – FY19), and
   b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’.
  Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “again and
 again and again” (yes, 3 again’s specifically mentioned) – and notes that guidance this time is no different.
In fact, if you look at $HIMX’s historical guidance, you will see that the company has consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1’17) – and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.
 
 So yes – as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this “again and again and again”!!! Let’s just say management is highly credible.
Top line guidance by segment:
- Large DDIC – to GROW by high single digit q-o-q helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.
- Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC (overall) – GROW low teens q-o-q and &gt;50% yoy By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:
   - Smartphones -&gt; GROW high teens q-o-q &amp; &gt;30% yoy
 - Tablet -&gt; flat q-o-q, and
   - Automotive -&gt; GROW double-digit q-o-q and &gt;100% yoy. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX’s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.
 Interestingly within the Smartphone segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features”.
Also, and more importantly “successful engagements with some key customers have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches”. i.e. winning more market share.
Lots to like here.
Automotive is $HIMX’s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share. Company notes that the “increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle
is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle”.
Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need
 to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.
 
 As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC segment, which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.
This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application (industrial application, from what I gather) – which is on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures).
 In addition, $HIMX also notes that the number of awarded projects in this segment is growing rapidly, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical...”to name a few”. Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.
$HIMX also notes “within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company’s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from cloud service providers who look for secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services”. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.
$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year. This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future.
 
 VALUATION &amp; Conclusion
The chart below compares Himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.
However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers – with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.
The average fair value on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 – representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.
  As for transaction comps, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents 21x EV/EBITDA – which if applied to $HIMX, gives a FV of $54/share or +370% upside!
Is $54/share possible here? Absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a few steps ahead of competition with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its
 existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.
We haven’t even discussed $HIMX’s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long- term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).
But I’d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game”, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.
Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary – although, that is probably some time away.
For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.

7th November 2021
Welcome to the Yield Fanatic’s Trade Idea series. This write up is on the Taiwanese
semiconductor business, Himax. The shares are listed on NASDAQ and the ticker is $HIMX.
The date of write up is 7th November 2021 – as I write this, $HIMX’s current share price is $11.45 and market cap is roughly $2.0 billion. Note that this isn’t part of the deep dive series like I mostly present but rather a unique tactical trade idea given where this company trades at the moment.
But as always, before we start, the disclaimer. A few points worth noting:
Firstly, this is not investment advice nor is it a recommendation to buy or sell any security. This is just the Yield Fanatic’s opinion of the stock in question. If you wish to seek advice, please do so from an accredited financial advisor, which the Yield Fanatic is not.
Secondly, the opinion shown in this presentation is based on Yield’s read of things. Your view may be different based on your read of things, but it is the difference in views and opinion that makes a market.
The aim of this write up and recording is to give you an unbiased VIEW of the opportunity in question. The aim is to give you all the data that you need to make your own decision.
And finally, the Yield Fanatic does have a position in Himax at present and so, the opinions expressed here may be biased. This is a name that I have traded in the past and which I will continually trade in and out of.
To be clear, the Yield Fanatic does reserve to trade or invest in the name, subject to views and valuation at that specific point in time.
   Finally and before we start, note that this was originally written up for the purpose of posting on Reddit, so the tone may seem different to the one normally adopted on my other pieces of work.
 $HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present. TLDR:
 1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company – trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!
 The shares are cheap in a more “normal” S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as stupid cheap with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation
 2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.
3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4’21 and even Q1’22, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have consistently delivered

 results “to guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether.
 4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year – representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.
 5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.
  ..and now for the fun bit:
 6. Potential for a significant short squeeze. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were ~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to ~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.
 The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short – and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “GME X’mas special”.
7. Cant confirm this (unconfirmed hearsay) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up..... and it has already shot up ~15% last couple of weeks.
  Disclosure: I own stock + Jan’22 and Mar’22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan’22 and $10 Mar’22).
 
 What does $HIMX do? Products?
 Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here’s a quick snippet of what Himax does:
$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make ‘panels’ which are, in turn, used in:
 - Large sized DDICs -&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc
 - Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs -&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc
   In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:
- High end Timing Controller which improves power efficiency in displays
   - WiseEye ultra power AI --&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ AI and ML to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet
 of Things (IoT) area.
 
  - Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays – with usage in AR/VR glasses, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), Holographic Displays, etc.
 
- Other products in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)
  As a summary – the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:
 
Revenue by segment:
Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) – with Automotive OEM representing ~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs ~12.5%.
  However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.
The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.
  
 Competitors and Market Shares:
In the Q3’21 presentation (available here), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).
You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.
As for market share by the individual segments, as of Q3’21, $HIMX’s market shares were:
   - Large DDIC: 10.5%
  - Smartphones: 10.4%
 - Tablets: 37.7% but note that $HIMX has &gt; 60% market share of Android / non iOS tablets – the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.
   - Automotive OEM: 32.8%
  So, what has been happening recently with Himax?
2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.
Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products.
 
 $HIMX management foresaw that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes”, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.
When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially.... and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.
Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX
 found itself in a very sweet spot.
This gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked. When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players), $HIMX walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!
This allowed it to take a decent amount of market share over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.
So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?
$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) .....but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like Internet of Things (IoT) and Automotive/vehicles.
In addition, the modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV) would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.
   
 On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such 5G and high performance computing (HPC) – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its DDIC business used.
In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for, some time ago.
I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.
Isn’t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?
As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 – this is from a combination of
  more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.
However, $HIMX was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand.... and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.
$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.
So yes, for now – the demand will persist, and as management has said, this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage.
Now, that’s the background. Supply secured along with said demand.
SHORT SQUEEZE
Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear Short Squeeze candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 – and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the “GME X’mas special”.
So, why do I mention a ‘SHORT SQUEEZE’ – well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest
  is around 24.7m shares, representing ~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting ~11 days to cover.
However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.
Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of “short availability utilization”. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “GME X’mas special”.
 
 With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.
 https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) – so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.
  
 As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun’21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.
The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs.
I understand the short-thesis – I really do.
Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.
The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent
guidance seems to suggest otherwise.
I can personally find NO REASON to be short this stock anymore at least for the next 7 months, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4’21 and decent outlook for Q1’22) and then we will have a dividend payment in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).
From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.
The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.
But now, its time for a reversal.
   
 The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)
$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul’21).
The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been ~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.
So far, YTD Q3’21, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.
  An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!
That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.
The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July – so we have some time. But let’s face it, everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.
Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. An earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks.
Company has bought back shares previously – and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so I wouldn’t put a potential stock buyback past the company.
All in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen ~15% over the last few weeks, it’s quite a surprise that the stock hasn’t rallied much more.
More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).
A question from the “Growth Bros”: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?
A common question – and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.
  But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light. So, 2 points worth noting:
1. Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is ‘reinvestment’. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
   2. Reasonably capex-light business: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.
  Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

 - R&amp;D – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and
  - Capex - including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase
 In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their ‘investment phase’, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.
So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so, why hasn’t
  the share price gone up then?
Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.
Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20’s performance) as well.
Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.
  Hedge Funds’ share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 – when performance improved dramatically.
 
 Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.
Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.
So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn’t stock kept pace?
Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.
   Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. More on valuation at the end.
The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION! Folks believe that this stock is manipulated by Market Makers (MMs) who are often option sellers on $HIMX. Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed.
With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it’s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!
Q3 Earnings
Now – let’s discuss the recent earnings
Q3’21 revenue: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)
Q3’21 gross margin: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2’21 and vs 22.3% in Q3’20 (guidance was 50.5-52%) Q3’21 EBITDA: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here! Q3’21 Levered FCF of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.
  The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.
 
 Charts for annual performance incl LTM Sep’21 and YTD Sep’21 are shown below:
 So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.
 
 GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market
 Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.
Why was the market waiting on guidance? Because indications were that:
(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,
(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline) (c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)
 Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure......or at least that’s what the shorts were betting on.
Before I go into $HIMX’s guidance, let’s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) – which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4
+
its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:
 - Q4’21 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and
  - Q4’21 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.
 This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) – so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.
But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:
 - Q4 revenue would INCREASE by +4% to +8% q-o-q,
  - Gross margin: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)
  - Q4 IFRS EPS (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs
 prior year (Q4’20) of $0.195 → i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!
  - Q4 non IFRS EPS (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)
 Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!
To be fair, the margin decrease is more of a dilutionary effect than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.
“It’s simple math”, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX’s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.
 
 However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact.
But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through. In other words – earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.
This level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)
Mr. Lopez’s question is below:
 The answer to this question was pretty much that
a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 – FY19), and
   b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’.
  Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “again and
 again and again” (yes, 3 again’s specifically mentioned) – and notes that guidance this time is no different.
In fact, if you look at $HIMX’s historical guidance, you will see that the company has consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1’17) – and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.
 
 So yes – as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this “again and again and again”!!! Let’s just say management is highly credible.
Top line guidance by segment:
- Large DDIC – to GROW by high single digit q-o-q helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.
- Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC (overall) – GROW low teens q-o-q and &gt;50% yoy By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:
   - Smartphones -&gt; GROW high teens q-o-q &amp; &gt;30% yoy
 - Tablet -&gt; flat q-o-q, and
   - Automotive -&gt; GROW double-digit q-o-q and &gt;100% yoy. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX’s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.
 Interestingly within the Smartphone segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features”.
Also, and more importantly “successful engagements with some key customers have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches”. i.e. winning more market share.
Lots to like here.
Automotive is $HIMX’s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share. Company notes that the “increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle
is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle”.
Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need
 to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.
 
 As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC segment, which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.
This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application (industrial application, from what I gather) – which is on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures).
 In addition, $HIMX also notes that the number of awarded projects in this segment is growing rapidly, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical...”to name a few”. Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.
$HIMX also notes “within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company’s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from cloud service providers who look for secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services”. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.
$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year. This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future.
 
 VALUATION &amp; Conclusion
The chart below compares Himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.
However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers – with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.
The average fair value on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 – representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.
  As for transaction comps, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents 21x EV/EBITDA – which if applied to $HIMX, gives a FV of $54/share or +370% upside!
Is $54/share possible here? Absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a few steps ahead of competition with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its
 existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.
We haven’t even discussed $HIMX’s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long- term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).
But I’d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game”, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.
Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary – although, that is probably some time away.
For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.
Let’s squeeze this one dry. GME X’mas special.

power efficiency display WiseEye ultra power AI gt ultralow power sensor added ability employ AI ML analyse collected data within chip rather relying transmission cloud Usage across variety device especially within broader Internet Things IoT area Liquid Cystal Silicon LCoS microdisplays usage AR VR glass Automotive Head Displays HUD Holographic Displays etc Other product Wafer Level Optics WLO D sensing facial recognition technology phone etc As summary picture give idea product used Revenue segment Revenue split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC Smartphone Android Tablets division roughly Automotive OEM representing revenue aa Last Twelve Month LTM basis Non driver ICs However HIMX seen significant growth Automotive OEMs expects segment represent largest segment going forward The Q revenue split segment shown Competitors Market Shares In Q presentation available HIMX note th largest DDIC player globally market share behind Novatek Samsung also customer LX Semicon SiliconWorks You may also familiar listed business smaller DDIC contribution revenue including FocalTech Synaptics Sitronix Mediatek As market share individual segment Q HIMX market share Large DDIC Smartphones Tablets note HIMX gt market share Android non iOS tablet quoted across tablet including Apple Automotive OEM So happening recently Himax excellent year HIMX demand consumer electronics spiked also company anticipated significant shortage foundry capacity impacting semiconductor Company realized quite early even covid significant foundry capacity shortage especially specific mature node product HIMX management foresaw historical lack investment mature node combined increasing demand product well new product use exactly mature node would result significant shortage foundry capacity So last year HIMX cosied foundry partner entered long term contract secure additional supply When covid hit early corporates cancelled product order extra foundry capacity came market initially HIMX capitalized opportunity secure even foundry supply Covid blessing disguise HIMX able secure supply enter much better deal significant increase demand end product meant HIMX found sweet spot This gamble paid well demand spiked When many DDIC provider caught pant due lack sufficient foundry supply especially non Taiwanese player HIMX walked full jump suit colourful one This allowed take decent amount market share course last year The graph show significant jump market share Smartphone Tablets segment especially FY So increase demand management foresaw HIMX management expected see demand increasing higher end version existing product consumer electronics broadly speaking also saw increasing adoption HQ screen new area like Internet Things IoT Automotive vehicle In addition modernisation electrification vehicle EV would boost requirement screen At time slightly unrelated worth mentioning also noted increase adoption would also require chip reduce power consumption significantly This resulted business working option come related product form part Non Driver IC business lot growth potential In word business invested potential diversification away DDICs related product On top increasing demand higher end existing product screen adoption area electrification vehicle etc management also noted unrelated application G high performance computing HPC would also require component use mature node DDIC business used In word HIMX management foresaw increasing demand would come supply shortage started preparing time ago I guess show management excellent Isn adding long term supply time demand spiked risky Will demand persist As mentioned earlier HIMX added market share combination volume existing client well adding new client However HIMX smart entered deal panel maker customer well leading end customer e consumer electronics automotive OEM brand In word increase supply HIMX taking matched increase demand HIMX satisfying demand HIMX taken prepayment deposit customer wanted secure supply component product HIMX foreseeable future So yes demand persist management said demand persist much given clear capacity shortage still experienced industry HIMX inability fulfil order due capacity shortage Now background Supply secured along said demand SHORT SQUEEZE Before going Q result released Thursday th November probably worth mentioning I believe HIMX clear Short Squeeze candidate To every possibility GME round dear friend said given timing opportunity even called GME X ma special So I mention SHORT SQUEEZE well according data th October short interest around share representing float Bloomberg noting day cover However data October I believe short interest increased going earnings Q earnings th November meaning currently short interest likely gt float Lack stock availability mean gt short availability utilization A big short squeeze coming This GME X ma special With earnings way good result much better expected guidance literally good reason anyone short stock near term let alone fact little availability short anyway give stats borrow availability see chart Currently show k borrow availability IBKR whole lot considering daily volume average around million As see stock borrow availability quite low We similar level limited availability Jun stock jumped end May high gt intraday th June The increase stock price squeezed short significantly saw stock rally cool odd I think see shortly uncertainty removed could rally much much higher previous high I understand short thesis I really Potential sale decline end consumer demand certain product falling alongside margin pressure foundry HIMX supplier raise price could created perfect doomsday scenario putting huge pressure stock price That good fair thesis The whole short thesis predicated potential reversal performance recent guidance seems suggest otherwise I personally find NO REASON short stock anymore least next month especially given solid guidance We pretty much clarity next quarter full guidance Q decent outlook Q dividend payment July record date usually Jun From I hear mind unconfirmed hearsay much short position held Asian hedge fund increasing short position ahead earnings The short interest jumped share th June dividend record date th October The share price turn collapsed closing price th June low th October But time reversal The Dividend maybe even stock buyback HIMX historically paid EPS dividend For FY HIMX paid IFRS fully diluted EPS dividend paid Jul The average payout since FY FY Fair assume payout IFRS fully diluted EPS continues year So far YTD Q IFRS fully diluted EPS Company recently gave Q guidance Assuming mid point guidance arrive potential fully diluted EPS FY share An payout mean dividend share represents dividend yield given share price today That dear friend crazy cost short The dividend usually declared June paid July time But let face everyone math long institution jump band wagon Now course assuming fund distributed dividend An earlier distribution also likely potentially share buyback Company bought back share previously honest share look ridiculously cheap given performance I put potential stock buyback past company All significant upward pressure price although share already risen last week quite surprise stock rallied much More valuation later end write A question Growth Bros paying dividend mean business grow A common question I get Not many dividend paying business grow like HIMX Understandable But note HIMX DDIC peer fable design house meaning capex light So point worth noting Dividend based EPS net R amp D expense gt reinvestment R amp D spent new product innovation upgrade mostly Reasonably capex light business HIMX fable involve significant amount capex Also HIMX invested significantly R amp D capex FY FY given expectation potential surge demand product Specifically focussed developing new product line upgrading existing product R amp D including spend upgrade existing product line move towards higher quality product range like product K K TVs well focus developing new product non DDIC business Capex including payment secure additional foundry capacity well expansion existing production capability existing product including land purchase In word year pain FY FY effectively investment phase HIMX shareholder enjoying fruit hard earned labour today So performance great massive shareholder distribution coming share price gone Well question still haunt longs name Performance valuation side company reinstated dividend FY performance well Perhaps answer stock predominantly owned traded retail investor However changing hedge fund institution getting involved The chart show change time Hedge Funds share increased outstanding stock today institutional incl mutual fund ownership increased FY today Note much increase came FY FY performance improved dramatically Much attributed company actively marketing attending conference pitching institution The institutional HF participation set increase opinion Also note founder CEO family owns company So performance getting better institutional ownership improving stock kept pace Well firstly stock climbed significantly since jumped mere share share today The high stock th June price since declined despite performance improving Although share price increased performance much better valuation today still significantly cheaper v peer More valuation end The belief amongst longs MANIPULATION Folks believe stock manipulated Market Makers MMs often option seller HIMX Retail trade option much actively stock giving incentive MMs keep stock price depressed With performance outlook well potential stockholder distribution divi stock buyback side time TAKE BACK CONTROL Q Earnings Now let discus recent earnings Q revenue yoy q q guidance q q Q gross margin v Q v Q guidance Q EBITDA x yoy q q impact operating leverage clearly visible Q Levered FCF bringing YTD FCF The chart show quarterly performance clearly Charts annual performance incl LTM Sep YTD Sep shown So Q result came higher end guidance Excellent GUIDANCE positively surprising market Performance going decent However Q guidance market eagerly waiting short keeping close eye Why market waiting guidance Because indication consumer demand TV smartphones fading b panel maker feeling pain e HIMX customer seeing pricing decline c foundry raising price e HIMX supplier raising price Worries around cost increase fading demand would mean mix topline AND margin pressure least short betting Before I go HIMX guidance let say market following panel maker HIMX customer guiding lower volume Q nearest largest competitor Novatek released guidance Thursday th Nov morning stating Q revenue would decline q q Q gross margin would decline registered Q This Novatek guidance better market feared Novatek stock rose Taiwan waiting HIMX report something similar But HIMX KILLED IT Why It reported Q revenue would INCREASE q q Gross margin would fall around reported Q Q IFRS EPS dividend based YTD already v prior year Q e forecast grow roughly x Q non IFRS EPS adjusted non recurring item SBC v prior year Q x roughly Yes margin marginally e foundry raising price one expected growth revenue coming To fair margin decrease dilutionary effect cost increase impact HIMX passing price increase customer anyway It simple math CEO explained call He noted original foundry cost HIMX selling price gt gross margin would However foundry raised price HIMX passed customer selling price increased margin would gt dilutionary impact rather pure profitability impact But I said earlier one expected growth revenue coming In word earnings good guidance took market surprise This level surprise best encapsulated question Vertical Group analyst Jon Lopez analyst SELL rating HIMX target expectation bad Q perhaps Mr Lopez question The answer question pretty much HIMX giving lot lower end business price competition rampant return higher end HQ business get industry recognition company aggressively investing product suite upgrade FY FY b HIMX building relationship top tier brand directly rather going panel maker making demand product defensive Management also alluded proven sale performance v guidance yes specifically mentioned note guidance time different In fact look HIMX historical guidance see company consistently delivered earnings within guidance least last quarter since Q case either higher end guidance beat altogether So yes CEO Jordan Wu note company history delivering beating guidance shown Let say management highly credible Top line guidance segment Large DDIC GROW high single digit q q helped growth notebook monitor although TV sale drop slightly due softer end market However HIMX remains positive large DDIC given shortage wafer capacity Small amp Mid sized DDIC overall GROW low teen q q gt yoy By sub segment within small amp mid sized DDIC Smartphones gt GROW high teen q q amp gt yoy Tablet gt flat q q Automotive gt GROW double digit q q gt yoy Stalled capacity restricting HIMX ability meet customer demand significant shortage still persists Interestingly within Smartphone segment HIMX mkt share company note undertaking new design development supporting higher frame rate ultra slim bezel higher resolution feature Also importantly successful engagement key customer achieved Q customer indicating interest next launch e winning market share Lots like Automotive HIMX highest growth area hold growing market share Company note increase number size sophistication display inside vehicle evolving rapid rate indicating much DDIC demand per vehicle Not going write extract Q earnings tell everything need know show positive future business within segment As noted earlier HIMX also non DDIC segment expected decline Q expected significant growth contributor onwards higher margin This segment includes component AR VR amp IoT application This longer term area worth watching adoption increase last quarter HIMX reported design win top tier name mainstream application industrial application I gather track enter mass production Q result visible figure In addition HIMX also note number awarded project segment growing rapidly covering broad range application including notebook home appliance utility meter automotive battery surveillance camera panoramic video conferencing medical name Some application already slated mass production end year meaning see benefit coming HIMX also note within year since HIMX started sampling company WiseEye solution also drawn much attention cloud service provider look secure low power edge AI device help collect big data cloud based service This open new market frontier area like smart city smart office healthcare agriculture retail factory automation HIMX anticipates design win award growing volume shipment starting next year This segment drive lot growth business future VALUATION amp Conclusion The chart compare Himax valuation v peer note competitor division apart DDIC make direct comp However metric LTM basis HIMX screen much cheaper v peer minimum upside Upside using traded comparables representing fair value share v today The average fair value traded comparables HIMX share representing upside v current share price As transaction comp South Korean DDIC business Magnachip MX US currently subject takeover offer Chinese private equity Wise Road Capital share US government trying stop This offer represents x EV EBITDA applied HIMX give FV share upside Is share possible Absolutely business growing nearest competitor Novatek actually declining This business invested future step ahead competition respect developing new product well upgrading existing product suite building direct relationship end brand We even discussed HIMX potential growth AR VR even mid long term plan nothing imminent next year But I say foot door already mean remain relevant game whether game physical digital even METAVERSE Yes Metaverse beneficiary although probably time away For I rest case Good business excellent valuation potential massive short squeeze Let squeeze one dry GME X ma special Positions k share dec

Again, full credit to YieldFanatic as I’m too retarded to do a DD like this one. But to be fair I tried to tell you retards about HIMAX a while back. YieldFanatic’s DD is more on the spectrum than mine though;


Himax Trade Idea - Script (Images missing)
7th November 2021
Welcome to the Yield Fanatic’s Trade Idea series. This write up is on the Taiwanese
semiconductor business, Himax. The shares are listed on NASDAQ and the ticker is $HIMX.
The date of write up is 7th November 2021 – as I write this, $HIMX’s current share price is $11.45 and market cap is roughly $2.0 billion. Note that this isn’t part of the deep dive series like I mostly present but rather a unique tactical trade idea given where this company trades at the moment.
But as always, before we start, the disclaimer. A few points worth noting:
Firstly, this is not investment advice nor is it a recommendation to buy or sell any security. This is just the Yield Fanatic’s opinion of the stock in question. If you wish to seek advice, please do so from an accredited financial advisor, which the Yield Fanatic is not.
Secondly, the opinion shown in this presentation is based on Yield’s read of things. Your view may be different based on your read of things, but it is the difference in views and opinion that makes a market.
The aim of this write up and recording is to give you an unbiased VIEW of the opportunity in question. The aim is to give you all the data that you need to make your own decision.
And finally, the Yield Fanatic does have a position in Himax at present and so, the opinions expressed here may be biased. This is a name that I have traded in the past and which I will continually trade in and out of.
To be clear, the Yield Fanatic does reserve to trade or invest in the name, subject to views and valuation at that specific point in time.
   Finally and before we start, note that this was originally written up for the purpose of posting on Reddit, so the tone may seem different to the one normally adopted on my other pieces of work.
 $HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present. TLDR:
 1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company – trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!
 The shares are cheap in a more “normal” S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as stupid cheap with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation
 2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.
3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4’21 and even Q1’22, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have consistently delivered

 results “to guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether.
 4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year – representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.
 5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.
  ..and now for the fun bit:
 6. Potential for a significant short squeeze. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were ~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to ~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.
 The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short – and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “GME X’mas special”.
7. Cant confirm this (unconfirmed hearsay) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up..... and it has already shot up ~15% last couple of weeks.
  Disclosure: I own stock + Jan’22 and Mar’22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan’22 and $10 Mar’22).
 
 What does $HIMX do? Products?
 Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here’s a quick snippet of what Himax does:
$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make ‘panels’ which are, in turn, used in:
 - Large sized DDICs -&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc
 - Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs -&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc
   In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:
- High end Timing Controller which improves power efficiency in displays
   - WiseEye ultra power AI --&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ AI and ML to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet
 of Things (IoT) area.
 
  - Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays – with usage in AR/VR glasses, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), Holographic Displays, etc.
 
- Other products in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)
  As a summary – the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:
 
Revenue by segment:
Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) – with Automotive OEM representing ~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs ~12.5%.
  However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.
The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.
  
 Competitors and Market Shares:
In the Q3’21 presentation (available here), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).
You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.
As for market share by the individual segments, as of Q3’21, $HIMX’s market shares were:
   - Large DDIC: 10.5%
  - Smartphones: 10.4%
 - Tablets: 37.7% but note that $HIMX has &gt; 60% market share of Android / non iOS tablets – the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.
   - Automotive OEM: 32.8%
  So, what has been happening recently with Himax?
2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.
Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products.
 
 $HIMX management foresaw that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes”, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.
When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially.... and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.
Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX
 found itself in a very sweet spot.
This gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked. When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players), $HIMX walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!
This allowed it to take a decent amount of market share over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.
So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?
$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) .....but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like Internet of Things (IoT) and Automotive/vehicles.
In addition, the modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV) would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.
   
 On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such 5G and high performance computing (HPC) – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its DDIC business used.
In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for, some time ago.
I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.
Isn’t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?
As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 – this is from a combination of
  more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.
However, $HIMX was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand.... and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.
$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.
So yes, for now – the demand will persist, and as management has said, this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage.
Now, that’s the background. Supply secured along with said demand.
SHORT SQUEEZE
Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear Short Squeeze candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 – and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the “GME X’mas special”.
So, why do I mention a ‘SHORT SQUEEZE’ – well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest
  is around 24.7m shares, representing ~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting ~11 days to cover.
However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.
Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of “short availability utilization”. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “GME X’mas special”.
 
 With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.
 https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) – so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.
  
 As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun’21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.
The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs.
I understand the short-thesis – I really do.
Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.
The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent
guidance seems to suggest otherwise.
I can personally find NO REASON to be short this stock anymore at least for the next 7 months, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4’21 and decent outlook for Q1’22) and then we will have a dividend payment in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).
From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.
The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.
But now, its time for a reversal.
   
 The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)
$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul’21).
The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been ~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.
So far, YTD Q3’21, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.
  An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!
That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.
The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July – so we have some time. But let’s face it, everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.
Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. An earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks.
Company has bought back shares previously – and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so I wouldn’t put a potential stock buyback past the company.
All in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen ~15% over the last few weeks, it’s quite a surprise that the stock hasn’t rallied much more.
More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).
A question from the “Growth Bros”: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?
A common question – and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.
  But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light. So, 2 points worth noting:
1. Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is ‘reinvestment’. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
   2. Reasonably capex-light business: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.
  Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

 - R&amp;D – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and
  - Capex - including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase
 In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their ‘investment phase’, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.
So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so, why hasn’t
  the share price gone up then?
Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.
Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20’s performance) as well.
Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.
  Hedge Funds’ share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 – when performance improved dramatically.
 
 Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.
Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.
So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn’t stock kept pace?
Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.
   Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. More on valuation at the end.
The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION! Folks believe that this stock is manipulated by Market Makers (MMs) who are often option sellers on $HIMX. Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed.
With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it’s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!
Q3 Earnings
Now – let’s discuss the recent earnings
Q3’21 revenue: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)
Q3’21 gross margin: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2’21 and vs 22.3% in Q3’20 (guidance was 50.5-52%) Q3’21 EBITDA: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here! Q3’21 Levered FCF of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.
  The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.
 
 Charts for annual performance incl LTM Sep’21 and YTD Sep’21 are shown below:
 So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.
 
 GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market
 Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.
Why was the market waiting on guidance? Because indications were that:
(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,
(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline) (c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)
 Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure......or at least that’s what the shorts were betting on.
Before I go into $HIMX’s guidance, let’s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) – which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4
+
its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:
 - Q4’21 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and
  - Q4’21 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.
 This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) – so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.
But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:
 - Q4 revenue would INCREASE by +4% to +8% q-o-q,
  - Gross margin: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)
  - Q4 IFRS EPS (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs
 prior year (Q4’20) of $0.195 → i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!
  - Q4 non IFRS EPS (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)
 Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!
To be fair, the margin decrease is more of a dilutionary effect than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.
“It’s simple math”, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX’s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.
 
 However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact.
But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through. In other words – earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.
This level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)
Mr. Lopez’s question is below:
 The answer to this question was pretty much that
a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 – FY19), and
   b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’.
  Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “again and
 again and again” (yes, 3 again’s specifically mentioned) – and notes that guidance this time is no different.
In fact, if you look at $HIMX’s historical guidance, you will see that the company has consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1’17) – and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.
 
 So yes – as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this “again and again and again”!!! Let’s just say management is highly credible.
Top line guidance by segment:
- Large DDIC – to GROW by high single digit q-o-q helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.
- Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC (overall) – GROW low teens q-o-q and &gt;50% yoy By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:
   - Smartphones -&gt; GROW high teens q-o-q &amp; &gt;30% yoy
 - Tablet -&gt; flat q-o-q, and
   - Automotive -&gt; GROW double-digit q-o-q and &gt;100% yoy. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX’s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.
 Interestingly within the Smartphone segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features”.
Also, and more importantly “successful engagements with some key customers have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches”. i.e. winning more market share.
Lots to like here.
Automotive is $HIMX’s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share. Company notes that the “increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle
is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle”.
Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need
 to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.
 
 As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC segment, which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.
This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application (industrial application, from what I gather) – which is on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures).
 In addition, $HIMX also notes that the number of awarded projects in this segment is growing rapidly, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical...”to name a few”. Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.
$HIMX also notes “within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company’s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from cloud service providers who look for secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services”. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.
$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year. This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future.
 
 VALUATION &amp; Conclusion
The chart below compares Himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.
However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers – with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.
The average fair value on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 – representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.
  As for transaction comps, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents 21x EV/EBITDA – which if applied to $HIMX, gives a FV of $54/share or +370% upside!
Is $54/share possible here? Absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a few steps ahead of competition with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its
 existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.
We haven’t even discussed $HIMX’s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long- term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).
But I’d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game”, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.
Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary – although, that is probably some time away.
For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.

Himax Trade Idea - Script (Images missing)
7th November 2021
Welcome to the Yield Fanatic’s Trade Idea series. This write up is on the Taiwanese
semiconductor business, Himax. The shares are listed on NASDAQ and the ticker is $HIMX.
The date of write up is 7th November 2021 – as I write this, $HIMX’s current share price is $11.45 and market cap is roughly $2.0 billion. Note that this isn’t part of the deep dive series like I mostly present but rather a unique tactical trade idea given where this company trades at the moment.
But as always, before we start, the disclaimer. A few points worth noting:
Firstly, this is not investment advice nor is it a recommendation to buy or sell any security. This is just the Yield Fanatic’s opinion of the stock in question. If you wish to seek advice, please do so from an accredited financial advisor, which the Yield Fanatic is not.
Secondly, the opinion shown in this presentation is based on Yield’s read of things. Your view may be different based on your read of things, but it is the difference in views and opinion that makes a market.
The aim of this write up and recording is to give you an unbiased VIEW of the opportunity in question. The aim is to give you all the data that you need to make your own decision.
And finally, the Yield Fanatic does have a position in Himax at present and so, the opinions expressed here may be biased. This is a name that I have traded in the past and which I will continually trade in and out of.
To be clear, the Yield Fanatic does reserve to trade or invest in the name, subject to views and valuation at that specific point in time.
   Finally and before we start, note that this was originally written up for the purpose of posting on Reddit, so the tone may seem different to the one normally adopted on my other pieces of work.
 $HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present. TLDR:
 1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company – trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!
 The shares are cheap in a more “normal” S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as stupid cheap with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation
 2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.
3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4’21 and even Q1’22, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have consistently delivered

 results “to guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether.
 4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year – representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.
 5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.
  ..and now for the fun bit:
 6. Potential for a significant short squeeze. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were ~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to ~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.
 The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short – and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “GME X’mas special”.
7. Cant confirm this (unconfirmed hearsay) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up..... and it has already shot up ~15% last couple of weeks.
  Disclosure: I own stock + Jan’22 and Mar’22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan’22 and $10 Mar’22).
 
 What does $HIMX do? Products?
 Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here’s a quick snippet of what Himax does:
$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make ‘panels’ which are, in turn, used in:
 - Large sized DDICs -&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc
 - Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs -&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc
   In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:
- High end Timing Controller which improves power efficiency in displays
   - WiseEye ultra power AI --&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ AI and ML to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet
 of Things (IoT) area.
 
  - Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays – with usage in AR/VR glasses, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), Holographic Displays, etc.
 
- Other products in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)
  As a summary – the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:
 
Revenue by segment:
Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) – with Automotive OEM representing ~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs ~12.5%.
  However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.
The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.
  
 Competitors and Market Shares:
In the Q3’21 presentation (available here), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).
You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.
As for market share by the individual segments, as of Q3’21, $HIMX’s market shares were:
   - Large DDIC: 10.5%
  - Smartphones: 10.4%
 - Tablets: 37.7% but note that $HIMX has &gt; 60% market share of Android / non iOS tablets – the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.
   - Automotive OEM: 32.8%
  So, what has been happening recently with Himax?
2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.
Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products.
 
 $HIMX management foresaw that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes”, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.
When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially.... and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.
Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX
 found itself in a very sweet spot.
This gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked. When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players), $HIMX walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!
This allowed it to take a decent amount of market share over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.
So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?
$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) .....but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like Internet of Things (IoT) and Automotive/vehicles.
In addition, the modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV) would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.
   
 On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such 5G and high performance computing (HPC) – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its DDIC business used.
In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for, some time ago.
I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.
Isn’t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?
As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 – this is from a combination of
  more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.
However, $HIMX was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand.... and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.
$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.
So yes, for now – the demand will persist, and as management has said, this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage.
Now, that’s the background. Supply secured along with said demand.
SHORT SQUEEZE
Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear Short Squeeze candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 – and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the “GME X’mas special”.
So, why do I mention a ‘SHORT SQUEEZE’ – well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest
  is around 24.7m shares, representing ~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting ~11 days to cover.
However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.
Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of “short availability utilization”. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “GME X’mas special”.
 
 With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.
 https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) – so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.
  
 As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun’21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.
The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs.
I understand the short-thesis – I really do.
Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.
The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent
guidance seems to suggest otherwise.
I can personally find NO REASON to be short this stock anymore at least for the next 7 months, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4’21 and decent outlook for Q1’22) and then we will have a dividend payment in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).
From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.
The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.
But now, its time for a reversal.
   
 The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)
$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul’21).
The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been ~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.
So far, YTD Q3’21, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.
  An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!
That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.
The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July – so we have some time. But let’s face it, everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.
Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. An earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks.
Company has bought back shares previously – and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so I wouldn’t put a potential stock buyback past the company.
All in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen ~15% over the last few weeks, it’s quite a surprise that the stock hasn’t rallied much more.
More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).
A question from the “Growth Bros”: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?
A common question – and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.
  But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light. So, 2 points worth noting:
1. Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is ‘reinvestment’. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
   2. Reasonably capex-light business: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.
  Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

 - R&amp;D – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and
  - Capex - including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase
 In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their ‘investment phase’, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.
So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so, why hasn’t
  the share price gone up then?
Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.
Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20’s performance) as well.
Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.
  Hedge Funds’ share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 – when performance improved dramatically.
 
 Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.
Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.
So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn’t stock kept pace?
Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.
   Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. More on valuation at the end.
The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION! Folks believe that this stock is manipulated by Market Makers (MMs) who are often option sellers on $HIMX. Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed.
With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it’s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!
Q3 Earnings
Now – let’s discuss the recent earnings
Q3’21 revenue: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)
Q3’21 gross margin: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2’21 and vs 22.3% in Q3’20 (guidance was 50.5-52%) Q3’21 EBITDA: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here! Q3’21 Levered FCF of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.
  The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.
 
 Charts for annual performance incl LTM Sep’21 and YTD Sep’21 are shown below:
 So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.
 
 GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market
 Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.
Why was the market waiting on guidance? Because indications were that:
(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,
(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline) (c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)
 Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure......or at least that’s what the shorts were betting on.
Before I go into $HIMX’s guidance, let’s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) – which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4
+
its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:
 - Q4’21 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and
  - Q4’21 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.
 This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) – so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.
But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:
 - Q4 revenue would INCREASE by +4% to +8% q-o-q,
  - Gross margin: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)
  - Q4 IFRS EPS (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs
 prior year (Q4’20) of $0.195 → i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!
  - Q4 non IFRS EPS (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)
 Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!
To be fair, the margin decrease is more of a dilutionary effect than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.
“It’s simple math”, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX’s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.
 
 However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact.
But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through. In other words – earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.
This level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)
Mr. Lopez’s question is below:
 The answer to this question was pretty much that
a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 – FY19), and
   b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’.
  Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “again and
 again and again” (yes, 3 again’s specifically mentioned) – and notes that guidance this time is no different.
In fact, if you look at $HIMX’s historical guidance, you will see that the company has consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1’17) – and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.
 
 So yes – as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this “again and again and again”!!! Let’s just say management is highly credible.
Top line guidance by segment:
- Large DDIC – to GROW by high single digit q-o-q helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.
- Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC (overall) – GROW low teens q-o-q and &gt;50% yoy By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:
   - Smartphones -&gt; GROW high teens q-o-q &amp; &gt;30% yoy
 - Tablet -&gt; flat q-o-q, and
   - Automotive -&gt; GROW double-digit q-o-q and &gt;100% yoy. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX’s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.
 Interestingly within the Smartphone segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features”.
Also, and more importantly “successful engagements with some key customers have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches”. i.e. winning more market share.
Lots to like here.
Automotive is $HIMX’s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share. Company notes that the “increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle
is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle”.
Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need
 to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.
 
 As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC segment, which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.
This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application (industrial application, from what I gather) – which is on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures).
 In addition, $HIMX also notes that the number of awarded projects in this segment is growing rapidly, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical...”to name a few”. Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.
$HIMX also notes “within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company’s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from cloud service providers who look for secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services”. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.
$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year. This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future.
 
 VALUATION &amp; Conclusion
The chart below compares Himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.
However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers – with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.
The average fair value on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 – representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.
  As for transaction comps, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents 21x EV/EBITDA – which if applied to $HIMX, gives a FV of $54/share or +370% upside!
Is $54/share possible here? Absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a few steps ahead of competition with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its
 existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.
We haven’t even discussed $HIMX’s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long- term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).
But I’d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game”, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.
Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary – although, that is probably some time away.
For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.

# $HIMX - a potential Short squeeze play. GME X'mas special!

**$HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present.**

**TLDR:**

1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company – trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!

The shares are cheap in a more “normal” S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as ***stupid cheap*** with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation

2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.

3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4’21 and even Q1’22, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have ***consistently delivered results “to guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether***\*.\*

4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year – representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.

5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.

..and now for the fun bit:

6. ***Potential for a significant short squeeze***. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were \~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to \~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.

The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short – and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a **“*****GME X’mas special*****”.**

7. Cant confirm this (***unconfirmed hearsay***) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an ***Asian hedge fund*** which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up….. and it has already shot up \~15% last couple of weeks.

Disclosure: I own stock + Jan’22 and Mar’22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan’22 and $10 Mar’22).

**What does $HIMX do? Products?**

Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here’s a quick snippet of what Himax does:

$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make ‘panels’ which are, in turn, used in:

\- ***Large sized DDICs*** \-&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc

\- ***Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs*** \-&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n5x51h81m9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfd9a80bb277f6c024707280df2ac0800213e008

In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:

\- ***High end Timing Controller***  which improves power efficiency in displays

\- ***WiseEye ultra power AI*** \--&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ ***AI and ML*** to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet of Things (IoT) area.

**Revenue by segment:**

Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) – with Automotive OEM representing \~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs \~12.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

***However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.***

The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.

**Competitors and Market Shares:**

In the Q3’21 presentation (available [here](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21_HIMX-Investor-Presentation_FInal.pdf)), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).

You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.

As for ***market share*** by the individual segments, as of Q3’21, $HIMX’s market shares were:

\- Large DDIC: 10.5%

\- Smartphones: 10.4%

\- ***Tablets: 37.7%*** but note that ***$HIMX has &gt; 60% market share*** of Android / non iOS tablets – the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.

\- ***Automotive OEM: 32.8%***

**So, what has been happening recently with Himax?**

2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.

Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products.

$HIMX management ***foresaw*** that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes”, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.

When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially…. and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.

***Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX*** – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX found itself in a very sweet spot.

This gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked. ***When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players),*** [***$HIMX***](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;src=cashtag_click) ***walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!***

This allowed it to ***take a decent amount of market share*** over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/068apgs4m9y71.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12cdaa1ee73ce6b8c1bc1c3a041b71d5441c3155

**So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?**

$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) …..but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like ***Internet of Things (IoT)*** and ***Automotive/vehicles***.

In addition, the ***modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV)*** would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that ***this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly***. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.

On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such ***5G and high performance computing (HPC)*** – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its DDIC business used.

In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for, some time ago.

***I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.***

**Isn’t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?**

As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 – this is from a combination of more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.

However, $HIMX was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand…. and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.

$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.

So yes, for now – the demand will persist, and as management has said, ***this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage***\*.\*

Now, that’s the background\*\*.\*\* ***Supply secured along with said demand.***

**SHORT SQUEEZE**

Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear ***Short Squeeze*** candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 – and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the “***GME X’mas special***”.

So, why do I mention a ‘***SHORT SQUEEZE***\*\*’\*\* – well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest is around 24.7m shares, representing \~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting \~11 days to cover.

However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.

Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of “short availability utilization”. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “***GME X’mas special***”.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e6jl8ja5m9y71.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bca75f3bff938bac1627c1ee400d55464ca456fd

With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, ***there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.***

[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX) gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) – so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kdsze7o5m9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8508d2baf167f705145fe82387697042098998fa

As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun’21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.

The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. ***I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs.***

I understand the short-thesis – I really do.

Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.

***The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent guidance seems to suggest otherwise.***

I can personally find ***NO REASON*** to be short this stock anymore at least for the ***next 7 months***, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4’21 and decent outlook for Q1’22) and then we will have a ***dividend payment*** in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).

***From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.***

The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.

***But now, its time for a reversal.***

**The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)**

$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul’21).

The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been \~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.

So far, YTD Q3’21, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.

An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a ***dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!***

***That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.***

The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July – so we have some time. But let’s face it, everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.

Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. ***An earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks.***

Company has bought back shares previously – and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so I wouldn’t put a potential stock buyback past the company.

All in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen \~15% over the last few weeks, it’s quite a surprise that the stock hasn’t rallied much more.

More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).

**A question from the “Growth Bros”: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?**

A common question – and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.

But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light.

So, 2 points worth noting:

1. ***Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is ‘reinvestment***\*\*’\*\*. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
2. ***Reasonably capex-light business***: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.

Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

\- ***R&amp;D*** – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and

\- ***Capex*** \- including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase

In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their ‘investment phase’, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.

**So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so, why hasn’t the share price gone up then?**

Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.

Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20’s performance) as well.

Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fktzhqb6m9y71.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c89e04defb6c099bc4b9bc42ffbbb8a629c300ea

Hedge Funds’ share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 – when performance improved dramatically.

Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. ***The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.***

Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.

**So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn’t stock kept pace?**

Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.

Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. ***More on valuation at the end***\*\*.\*\*

***The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION!*** Folks believe that this stock is ***manipulated by Market Makers (MMs)*** who are often option sellers on $HIMX\*\*.\*\* ***Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed***\*\*.\*\*

**With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it’s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!**

**Q3 Earnings**

Now – let’s discuss the recent earnings

***Q3’21 revenue***: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)

***Q3’21 gross margin***: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2’21 and vs 22.3% in Q3’20 (guidance was 50.5-52%)

**Q3’21 EBITDA**: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here!

***Q3’21 Levered FCF*** of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.

The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.

***So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.***

**GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market**

Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.

***Why was the market waiting on guidance?*** Because indications were that:

(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,

(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline)

(c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)

Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure……or at least that’s what the shorts were betting on.

Before I go into $HIMX’s guidance, let’s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) – which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4

\+

its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:

\- Q4’21 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and

\- Q4’21 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.

This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) – so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.

***But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:***

\- ***Q4 revenue*** would ***INCREASE*** by +4% to +8% q-o-q,

\- ***Gross margin***: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)

\- ***Q4 IFRS EPS*** (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.195 i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!

\- ***Q4 non IFRS EPS*** (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)

Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) ***but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!***

To be fair, the ***margin increase is more of a dilutionary effect*** than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.

“It’s simple math”, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX’s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.

However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; ***a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact***\*.\*

***But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through.*** In other words – earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.

This level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)

Mr. Lopez’s question is below:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1u3gy7v7m9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d297a98c6bf56b94befc9944e71213700183033

The answer to this question was pretty much that

a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (*the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 – FY19*), and

b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’.

Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “***again and again and again***” (yes, 3 again’s specifically mentioned) – and notes that guidance this time is no different.

In fact, if you look at $HIMX’s historical guidance, you will see that the company has ***consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1’17) – and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.***

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p91sf7e8m9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d80df51e444182c244f0223e67d9318508036043

So yes – as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this “again and again and again”!!! Let’s just say ***management is highly credible.***

**Top line guidance by segment:**

\- ***Large DDIC*** – to ***GROW*** by ***high single digit q-o-q*** helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.

\- ***Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC*** (overall) – ***GROW*** ***low teens q-o-q*** and ***&gt;50% yoy***

By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:

\- ***Smartphones*** \-&gt; ***GROW*** ***high teens q-o-q*** &amp; ***&gt;30% yoy***

\- ***Tablet*** \-&gt; flat q-o-q, and

\- ***Automotive*** \-&gt; ***GROW*** ***double-digit q-o-q*** and ***&gt;100% yoy***. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX’s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.

Interestingly within the ***Smartphone*** segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features”.

Also, and more importantly ***“successful engagements with some key customers*** have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches”. i.e. ***winning more market share.***

***Lots to like here.***

***Automotive*** is $HIMX’s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share.

Company notes that the “increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle”.

Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.

&amp;#x200B;

As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a ***non-DDIC segment***\*,\* which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for ***AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.***

This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a ***design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application*** (industrial application, from what I gather) – which is ***on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures)****.*

In addition, $HIMX also notes that the ***number of awarded projects*** in this segment is ***growing rapidly***, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical…”to name a few”. ***Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.***

$HIMX also notes “within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company’s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from ***cloud service providers*** who look for ***secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services***”. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like ***smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.***

$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year.

***This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future***\*.\*

**VALUATION &amp; Conclusion**

The chart below compares Himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.

However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers – with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.

The ***average fair value*** on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 – representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.

As for ***transaction comps***, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents ***21x EV/EBITDA*** – which if applied to $HIMX, gives a ***FV of $54/share + 370% upside***\*!\*

***Is $54/share possible here?*** Absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a ***few steps ahead of competition*** with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.

We haven’t even discussed $HIMX’s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long-term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).

***But I’d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game”, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.***

***Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary*** – although, that is probably some time away.

For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.

# $HIMX - a potential Short squeeze play. GME X'mas special!

**$HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present.**

**TLDR:**

1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company – trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!

The shares are cheap in a more “normal” S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as ***stupid cheap*** with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation

2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.

3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4’21 and even Q1’22, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have ***consistently delivered results “to guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether***\*.\*

4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year – representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.

5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.

..and now for the fun bit:

6. ***Potential for a significant short squeeze***. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were \~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to \~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.

The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short – and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a **“*****GME X’mas special*****”.**

7. Cant confirm this (***unconfirmed hearsay***) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an ***Asian hedge fund*** which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up….. and it has already shot up \~15% last couple of weeks.

Disclosure: I own stock + Jan’22 and Mar’22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan’22 and $10 Mar’22).

**What does $HIMX do? Products?**

Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here’s a quick snippet of what Himax does:

$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make ‘panels’ which are, in turn, used in:

\- ***Large sized DDICs*** \-&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc

\- ***Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs*** \-&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n5x51h81m9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfd9a80bb277f6c024707280df2ac0800213e008

In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:

\- ***High end Timing Controller***  which improves power efficiency in displays

\- ***WiseEye ultra power AI*** \--&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ ***AI and ML*** to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet of Things (IoT) area.

**Revenue by segment:**

Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) – with Automotive OEM representing \~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs \~12.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k9wfeaf3m9y71.png?width=482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=075f8b8ecc9a7141c63f9854c4ef547874978c67

***However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.***

The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.

**Competitors and Market Shares:**

In the Q3’21 presentation (available [here](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21_HIMX-Investor-Presentation_FInal.pdf)), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).

You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.

As for ***market share*** by the individual segments, as of Q3’21, $HIMX’s market shares were:

\- Large DDIC: 10.5%

\- Smartphones: 10.4%

\- ***Tablets: 37.7%*** but note that ***$HIMX has &gt; 60% market share*** of Android / non iOS tablets – the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.

\- ***Automotive OEM: 32.8%***

**So, what has been happening recently with Himax?**

2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.

Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products.

$HIMX management ***foresaw*** that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes”, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.

When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially…. and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.

***Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX*** – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX found itself in a very sweet spot.

This gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked. ***When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players),*** [***$HIMX***](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;src=cashtag_click) ***walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!***

This allowed it to ***take a decent amount of market share*** over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/068apgs4m9y71.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12cdaa1ee73ce6b8c1bc1c3a041b71d5441c3155

**So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?**

$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) …..but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like ***Internet of Things (IoT)*** and ***Automotive/vehicles***.

In addition, the ***modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV)*** would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that ***this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly***. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.

On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such ***5G and high performance computing (HPC)*** – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its DDIC business used.

In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for, some time ago.

***I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.***

**Isn’t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?**

As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 – this is from a combination of more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.

However, $HIMX was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand…. and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.

$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.

So yes, for now – the demand will persist, and as management has said, ***this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage***\*.\*

Now, that’s the background\*\*.\*\* ***Supply secured along with said demand.***

**SHORT SQUEEZE**

Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear ***Short Squeeze*** candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 – and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the “***GME X’mas special***”.

So, why do I mention a ‘***SHORT SQUEEZE***\*\*’\*\* – well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest is around 24.7m shares, representing \~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting \~11 days to cover.

However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.

Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of “short availability utilization”. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “***GME X’mas special***”.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e6jl8ja5m9y71.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bca75f3bff938bac1627c1ee400d55464ca456fd

With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, ***there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.***

[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX) gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) – so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kdsze7o5m9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8508d2baf167f705145fe82387697042098998fa

As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun’21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.

The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. ***I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs.***

I understand the short-thesis – I really do.

Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.

***The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent guidance seems to suggest otherwise.***

I can personally find ***NO REASON*** to be short this stock anymore at least for the ***next 7 months***, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4’21 and decent outlook for Q1’22) and then we will have a ***dividend payment*** in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).

***From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.***

The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.

***But now, its time for a reversal.***

**The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)**

$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul’21).

The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been \~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.

So far, YTD Q3’21, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.

An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a ***dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!***

***That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.***

The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July – so we have some time. But let’s face it, everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.

Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. ***An earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks.***

Company has bought back shares previously – and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so I wouldn’t put a potential stock buyback past the company.

All in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen \~15% over the last few weeks, it’s quite a surprise that the stock hasn’t rallied much more.

More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).

**A question from the “Growth Bros”: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?**

A common question – and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.

But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light.

So, 2 points worth noting:

1. ***Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is ‘reinvestment***\*\*’\*\*. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
2. ***Reasonably capex-light business***: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.

Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

\- ***R&amp;D*** – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and

\- ***Capex*** \- including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase

In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their ‘investment phase’, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.

**So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so, why hasn’t the share price gone up then?**

Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.

Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20’s performance) as well.

Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fktzhqb6m9y71.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c89e04defb6c099bc4b9bc42ffbbb8a629c300ea

Hedge Funds’ share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 – when performance improved dramatically.

Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. ***The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.***

Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.

**So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn’t stock kept pace?**

Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.

Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. ***More on valuation at the end***\*\*.\*\*

***The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION!*** Folks believe that this stock is ***manipulated by Market Makers (MMs)*** who are often option sellers on $HIMX\*\*.\*\* ***Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed***\*\*.\*\*

**With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it’s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!**

**Q3 Earnings**

Now – let’s discuss the recent earnings

***Q3’21 revenue***: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)

***Q3’21 gross margin***: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2’21 and vs 22.3% in Q3’20 (guidance was 50.5-52%)

**Q3’21 EBITDA**: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here!

***Q3’21 Levered FCF*** of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.

The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.

***So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.***

**GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market**

Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.

***Why was the market waiting on guidance?*** Because indications were that:

(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,

(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline)

(c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)

Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure……or at least that’s what the shorts were betting on.

Before I go into $HIMX’s guidance, let’s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) – which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4

\+

its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:

\- Q4’21 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and

\- Q4’21 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.

This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) – so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.

***But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:***

\- ***Q4 revenue*** would ***INCREASE*** by +4% to +8% q-o-q,

\- ***Gross margin***: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)

\- ***Q4 IFRS EPS*** (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.195 i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!

\- ***Q4 non IFRS EPS*** (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)

Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) ***but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!***

To be fair, the ***margin increase is more of a dilutionary effect*** than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.

“It’s simple math”, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX’s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.

However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; ***a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact***\*.\*

***But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through.*** In other words – earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.

This level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)

Mr. Lopez’s question is below:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1u3gy7v7m9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d297a98c6bf56b94befc9944e71213700183033

The answer to this question was pretty much that

a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (*the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 – FY19*), and

b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’.

Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “***again and again and again***” (yes, 3 again’s specifically mentioned) – and notes that guidance this time is no different.

In fact, if you look at $HIMX’s historical guidance, you will see that the company has ***consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1’17) – and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.***

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p91sf7e8m9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d80df51e444182c244f0223e67d9318508036043

So yes – as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this “again and again and again”!!! Let’s just say ***management is highly credible.***

**Top line guidance by segment:**

\- ***Large DDIC*** – to ***GROW*** by ***high single digit q-o-q*** helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.

\- ***Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC*** (overall) – ***GROW*** ***low teens q-o-q*** and ***&gt;50% yoy***

By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:

\- ***Smartphones*** \-&gt; ***GROW*** ***high teens q-o-q*** &amp; ***&gt;30% yoy***

\- ***Tablet*** \-&gt; flat q-o-q, and

\- ***Automotive*** \-&gt; ***GROW*** ***double-digit q-o-q*** and ***&gt;100% yoy***. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX’s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.

Interestingly within the ***Smartphone*** segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features”.

Also, and more importantly ***“successful engagements with some key customers*** have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches”. i.e. ***winning more market share.***

***Lots to like here.***

***Automotive*** is $HIMX’s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share.

Company notes that the “increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle”.

Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.

&amp;#x200B;

As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a ***non-DDIC segment***\*,\* which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for ***AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.***

This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a ***design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application*** (industrial application, from what I gather) – which is ***on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures)****.*

In addition, $HIMX also notes that the ***number of awarded projects*** in this segment is ***growing rapidly***, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical…”to name a few”. ***Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.***

$HIMX also notes “within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company’s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from ***cloud service providers*** who look for ***secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services***”. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like ***smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.***

$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year.

***This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future***\*.\*

**VALUATION &amp; Conclusion**

The chart below compares Himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.

However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers – with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.

The ***average fair value*** on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 – representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.

As for ***transaction comps***, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents ***21x EV/EBITDA*** – which if applied to $HIMX, gives a ***FV of $54/share + 370% upside***\*!\*

***Is $54/share possible here?*** Absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a ***few steps ahead of competition*** with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.

We haven’t even discussed $HIMX’s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long-term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).

***But I’d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game”, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.***

***Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary*** – although, that is probably some time away.

For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.

**Let’s squeeze this one dry. GME X’mas special.**

**$HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present.**

**TLDR:**

1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company – trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!

The shares are cheap in a more “normal” S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as ***stupid cheap*** with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation

2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.

3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4’21 and even Q1’22, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have ***consistently delivered results “to guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether***\*.\*

4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year – representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.

5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.

..and now for the fun bit:

6. ***Potential for a significant short squeeze***. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were \~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to \~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.

The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short – and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a **“*****GME X’mas special*****”.**

7. Cant confirm this (***unconfirmed hearsay***) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an ***Asian hedge fund*** which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up….. and it has already shot up \~15% last couple of weeks.

Disclosure: I own stock + Jan’22 and Mar’22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan’22 and $10 Mar’22).

**What does $HIMX do? Products?**

Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here’s a quick snippet of what Himax does:

$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make ‘panels’ which are, in turn, used in:

\- ***Large sized DDICs*** \-&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc

\- ***Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs*** \-&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:

\- ***High end Timing Controller (TCON)*** which improves power efficiency in displays

\- ***WiseEye ultra power AI*** \--&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ ***AI and ML*** to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet of Things (IoT) area.

\- ***Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays*** – with usage in ***AR/VR glasses***, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), ***Holographic Displays***, etc.

Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) – with Automotive OEM representing \~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs \~12.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

***However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.***

The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.

**Competitors and Market Shares:**

In the Q3’21 presentation (available [here](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21_HIMX-Investor-Presentation_FInal.pdf)), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).

You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4b19dunkk9y71.png?width=387&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff42f097a70ba4aa43e1b97d377a4c64f84ba209

As for ***market share*** by the individual segments, as of Q3’21, $HIMX’s market shares were:

\- Large DDIC: 10.5%

\- Smartphones: 10.4%

\- ***Tablets: 37.7%*** but note that ***$HIMX has &gt; 60% market share*** of Android / non iOS tablets – the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.

\- ***Automotive OEM: 32.8%***

**So, what has been happening recently with Himax?**

2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.

Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products.

$HIMX management ***foresaw*** that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes”, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.

When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially…. and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.

***Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX*** – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX found itself in a very sweet spot.

This gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked. ***When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players),*** [***$HIMX***](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;src=cashtag_click) ***walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!***

This allowed it to ***take a decent amount of market share*** over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/phfpsc7lk9y71.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=105a9a81f695b40972159284b71221332b135fa3

**So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?**

$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) …..but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like ***Internet of Things (IoT)*** and ***Automotive/vehicles***.

In addition, the ***modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV)*** would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that ***this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly***. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.

On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such ***5G and high performance computing (HPC)*** – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its DDIC business used.

In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for, some time ago.

***I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.***

**Isn’t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?**

As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 – this is from a combination of more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.

However, $HIMX was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand…. and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.

$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.

So yes, for now – the demand will persist, and as management has said, ***this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage***\*.\*

Now, that’s the background\*\*.\*\* ***Supply secured along with said demand.***

**SHORT SQUEEZE**

Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear ***Short Squeeze*** candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 – and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the “***GME X’mas special***”.

So, why do I mention a ‘***SHORT SQUEEZE***\*\*’\*\* – well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest is around 24.7m shares, representing \~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting \~11 days to cover.

However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.

Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of “short availability utilization”. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “***GME X’mas special***”.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wlec4jnlk9y71.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7431b6338296b82f9ee58f4cd68efcf085006046

With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, ***there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.***

[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX) gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) – so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8gur681mk9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c19567105edc88b46b8a5ecb1fb38f267d2f1a08

As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun’21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.

The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. ***I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs.***

I understand the short-thesis – I really do.

Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.

***The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent guidance seems to suggest otherwise.***

I can personally find ***NO REASON*** to be short this stock anymore at least for the ***next 7 months***, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4’21 and decent outlook for Q1’22) and then we will have a ***dividend payment*** in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).

***From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.***

The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.

***But now, its time for a reversal.***

**The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)**

$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul’21).

The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been \~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.

So far, YTD Q3’21, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.

An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a ***dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!***

***That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.***

The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July – so we have some time. But let’s face it, everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.

Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. ***An earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks.***

Company has bought back shares previously – and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so I wouldn’t put a potential stock buyback past the company.

All in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen \~15% over the last few weeks, it’s quite a surprise that the stock hasn’t rallied much more.

More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).

**A question from the “Growth Bros”: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?**

A common question – and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.

But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light.

So, 2 points worth noting:

1. ***Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is ‘reinvestment***\*\*’\*\*. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
2. ***Reasonably capex-light business***: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.

Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

\- ***R&amp;D*** – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and

\- ***Capex*** \- including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase

In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their ‘investment phase’, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.

**So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so, why hasn’t the share price gone up then?**

Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.

Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20’s performance) as well.

Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fmymorlmk9y71.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=263b1739f6cc3a650e588fdfc56d4b6738627e1c

Hedge Funds’ share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 – when performance improved dramatically.

Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. ***The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.***

Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.

**So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn’t stock kept pace?**

Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.

Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. ***More on valuation at the end***\*\*.\*\*

***The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION!*** Folks believe that this stock is ***manipulated by Market Makers (MMs)*** who are often option sellers on $HIMX\*\*.\*\* ***Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed***\*\*.\*\*

**With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it’s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!**

**Q3 Earnings**

Now – let’s discuss the recent earnings

***Q3’21 revenue***: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)

***Q3’21 gross margin***: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2’21 and vs 22.3% in Q3’20 (guidance was 50.5-52%)

**Q3’21 EBITDA**: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here!

***Q3’21 Levered FCF*** of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.

The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.

***So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.***

**GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market**

Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.

***Why was the market waiting on guidance?*** Because indications were that:

(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,

(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline)

(c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)

Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure……or at least that’s what the shorts were betting on.

Before I go into $HIMX’s guidance, let’s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) – which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4

\+

its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:

\- Q4’21 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and

\- Q4’21 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.

This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) – so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.

***But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:***

\- ***Q4 revenue*** would ***INCREASE*** by +4% to +8% q-o-q,

\- ***Gross margin***: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)

\- ***Q4 IFRS EPS*** (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.195 i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!

\- ***Q4 non IFRS EPS*** (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)

Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) ***but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!***

To be fair, the ***margin increase is more of a dilutionary effect*** than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.

“It’s simple math”, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX’s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.

However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; ***a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact***\*.\*

***But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through.*** In other words – earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.

This level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)

Mr. Lopez’s question is below:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7o5zrc2ok9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70ace07de87afe215430326d27d1167ffd4c658c

The answer to this question was pretty much that

a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (*the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 – FY19*), and

b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’.

Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “***again and again and again***” (yes, 3 again’s specifically mentioned) – and notes that guidance this time is no different.

In fact, if you look at $HIMX’s historical guidance, you will see that the company has ***consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1’17) – and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.***

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s0yjfpkok9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a10edbd9f81926ce7deae84be3ff51cda607343

So yes – as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this “again and again and again”!!! Let’s just say ***management is highly credible.***

**Top line guidance by segment:**

\- ***Large DDIC*** – to ***GROW*** by ***high single digit q-o-q*** helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.

\- ***Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC*** (overall) – ***GROW*** ***low teens q-o-q*** and ***&gt;50% yoy***

By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:

\- ***Smartphones*** \-&gt; ***GROW*** ***high teens q-o-q*** &amp; ***&gt;30% yoy***

\- ***Tablet*** \-&gt; flat q-o-q, and

\- ***Automotive*** \-&gt; ***GROW*** ***double-digit q-o-q*** and ***&gt;100% yoy***. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX’s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.

Interestingly within the ***Smartphone*** segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features”.

Also, and more importantly ***“successful engagements with some key customers*** have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches”. i.e. ***winning more market share.***

***Lots to like here.***

***Automotive*** is $HIMX’s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share.

Company notes that the “increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle”.

Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vxurb10pk9y71.png?width=575&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f96ab1778b831b523496516c34108fc13244e799

As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a ***non-DDIC segment***\*,\* which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for ***AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.***

This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a ***design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application*** (industrial application, from what I gather) – which is ***on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures)****.*

In addition, $HIMX also notes that the ***number of awarded projects*** in this segment is ***growing rapidly***, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical…”to name a few”. ***Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.***

$HIMX also notes “within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company’s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from ***cloud service providers*** who look for ***secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services***”. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like ***smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.***

$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year.

***This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future***\*.\*

**VALUATION &amp; Conclusion**

The chart below compares Himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.

However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers – with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.

The ***average fair value*** on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 – representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ezz84rgpk9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1eb5d23d015cff079b91d4871910d7cc5df88483

As for ***transaction comps***, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents ***21x EV/EBITDA*** – which if applied to $HIMX, gives a ***FV of $54/share + 370% upside***\*!\*

***Is $54/share possible here?*** Absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a ***few steps ahead of competition*** with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.

We haven’t even discussed $HIMX’s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long-term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).

***But I’d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game”, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.***

***Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary*** – although, that is probably some time away.

For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.

**Let’s squeeze this one dry. GME X’mas special.**

**$HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present.**

**TLDR:**

1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company – trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!

The shares are cheap in a more “normal” S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as ***stupid cheap*** with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation

2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.

3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4’21 and even Q1’22, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have ***consistently delivered results “to guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether***\*.\*

4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year – representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.

5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.

..and now for the fun bit:

6. ***Potential for a significant short squeeze***. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were \~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to \~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.

The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short – and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a **“*****GME X’mas special*****”.**

7. Cant confirm this (***unconfirmed hearsay***) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an ***Asian hedge fund*** which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up….. and it has already shot up \~15% last couple of weeks.

Disclosure: I own stock + Jan’22 and Mar’22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan’22 and $10 Mar’22).

**What does $HIMX do? Products?**

Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here’s a quick snippet of what Himax does:

$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make ‘panels’ which are, in turn, used in:

\- ***Large sized DDICs*** \-&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc

\- ***Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs*** \-&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:

\- ***High end Timing Controller (TCON)*** which improves power efficiency in displays

\- ***WiseEye ultra power AI*** \--&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ ***AI and ML*** to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet of Things (IoT) area.

As a summary – the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:

**Revenue by segment:**

Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) – with Automotive OEM representing \~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs \~12.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

***However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.***

The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.

**Competitors and Market Shares:**

In the Q3’21 presentation (available [here](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21_HIMX-Investor-Presentation_FInal.pdf)), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).

You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.

As for ***market share*** by the individual segments, as of Q3’21, $HIMX’s market shares were:

\- Large DDIC: 10.5%

\- Smartphones: 10.4%

\- ***Tablets: 37.7%*** but note that ***$HIMX has &gt; 60% market share*** of Android / non iOS tablets – the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.

\- ***Automotive OEM: 32.8%***

**So, what has been happening recently with Himax?**

2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.

Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products.

$HIMX management ***foresaw*** that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes”, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.

When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially…. and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.

***Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX*** – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX found itself in a very sweet spot.

This gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked. ***When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players),*** [***$HIMX***](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;src=cashtag_click) ***walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!***

This allowed it to ***take a decent amount of market share*** over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/phfpsc7lk9y71.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=105a9a81f695b40972159284b71221332b135fa3

**So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?**

$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) …..but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like ***Internet of Things (IoT)*** and ***Automotive/vehicles***.

In addition, the ***modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV)*** would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that ***this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly***. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.

On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such ***5G and high performance computing (HPC)*** – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its DDIC business used.

In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for, some time ago.

***I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.***

**Isn’t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?**

As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 – this is from a combination of more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.

However, $HIMX was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand…. and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.

$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.

So yes, for now – the demand will persist, and as management has said, ***this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage***\*.\*

Now, that’s the background\*\*.\*\* ***Supply secured along with said demand.***

**SHORT SQUEEZE**

Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear ***Short Squeeze*** candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 – and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the “***GME X’mas special***”.

So, why do I mention a ‘***SHORT SQUEEZE***\*\*’\*\* – well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest is around 24.7m shares, representing \~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting \~11 days to cover.

However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.

Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of “short availability utilization”. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “***GME X’mas special***”.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wlec4jnlk9y71.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7431b6338296b82f9ee58f4cd68efcf085006046

With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, ***there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.***

[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX) gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) – so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8gur681mk9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c19567105edc88b46b8a5ecb1fb38f267d2f1a08

As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun’21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.

The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. ***I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs.***

I understand the short-thesis – I really do.

Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.

***The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent guidance seems to suggest otherwise.***

I can personally find ***NO REASON*** to be short this stock anymore at least for the ***next 7 months***, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4’21 and decent outlook for Q1’22) and then we will have a ***dividend payment*** in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).

***From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.***

The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.

***But now, its time for a reversal.***

**The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)**

$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul’21).

The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been \~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.

So far, YTD Q3’21, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.

An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a ***dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!***

***That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.***

The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July – so we have some time. But let’s face it, everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.

Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. ***An earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks.***

Company has bought back shares previously – and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so I wouldn’t put a potential stock buyback past the company.

All in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen \~15% over the last few weeks, it’s quite a surprise that the stock hasn’t rallied much more.

More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).

**A question from the “Growth Bros”: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?**

A common question – and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.

But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light.

So, 2 points worth noting:

1. ***Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is ‘reinvestment***\*\*’\*\*. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
2. ***Reasonably capex-light business***: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.

Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

\- ***R&amp;D*** – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and

\- ***Capex*** \- including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase

In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their ‘investment phase’, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.

**So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so, why hasn’t the share price gone up then?**

Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.

Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20’s performance) as well.

Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fmymorlmk9y71.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=263b1739f6cc3a650e588fdfc56d4b6738627e1c

Hedge Funds’ share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 – when performance improved dramatically.

Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. ***The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.***

Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.

**So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn’t stock kept pace?**

Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.

Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. ***More on valuation at the end***\*\*.\*\*

***The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION!*** Folks believe that this stock is ***manipulated by Market Makers (MMs)*** who are often option sellers on $HIMX\*\*.\*\* ***Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed***\*\*.\*\*

**With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it’s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!**

**Q3 Earnings**

Now – let’s discuss the recent earnings

***Q3’21 revenue***: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)

***Q3’21 gross margin***: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2’21 and vs 22.3% in Q3’20 (guidance was 50.5-52%)

**Q3’21 EBITDA**: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here!

***Q3’21 Levered FCF*** of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.

The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.

***So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.***

**GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market**

Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.

***Why was the market waiting on guidance?*** Because indications were that:

(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,

(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline)

(c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)

Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure……or at least that’s what the shorts were betting on.

Before I go into $HIMX’s guidance, let’s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) – which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4

\+

its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:

\- Q4’21 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and

\- Q4’21 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.

This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) – so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.

***But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:***

\- ***Q4 revenue*** would ***INCREASE*** by +4% to +8% q-o-q,

\- ***Gross margin***: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)

\- ***Q4 IFRS EPS*** (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.195 i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!

\- ***Q4 non IFRS EPS*** (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)

Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) ***but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!***

To be fair, the ***margin increase is more of a dilutionary effect*** than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.

“It’s simple math”, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX’s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.

However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; ***a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact***\*.\*

***But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through.*** In other words – earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.

This level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)

Mr. Lopez’s question is below:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7o5zrc2ok9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70ace07de87afe215430326d27d1167ffd4c658c

The answer to this question was pretty much that

a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (*the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 – FY19*), and

b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’.

Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “***again and again and again***” (yes, 3 again’s specifically mentioned) – and notes that guidance this time is no different.

In fact, if you look at $HIMX’s historical guidance, you will see that the company has ***consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1’17) – and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.***

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s0yjfpkok9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a10edbd9f81926ce7deae84be3ff51cda607343

So yes – as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this “again and again and again”!!! Let’s just say ***management is highly credible.***

**Top line guidance by segment:**

\- ***Large DDIC*** – to ***GROW*** by ***high single digit q-o-q*** helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.

\- ***Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC*** (overall) – ***GROW*** ***low teens q-o-q*** and ***&gt;50% yoy***

By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:

\- ***Smartphones*** \-&gt; ***GROW*** ***high teens q-o-q*** &amp; ***&gt;30% yoy***

\- ***Tablet*** \-&gt; flat q-o-q, and

\- ***Automotive*** \-&gt; ***GROW*** ***double-digit q-o-q*** and ***&gt;100% yoy***. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX’s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.

Interestingly within the ***Smartphone*** segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features”.

Also, and more importantly ***“successful engagements with some key customers*** have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches”. i.e. ***winning more market share.***

***Lots to like here.***

***Automotive*** is $HIMX’s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share.

Company notes that the “increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle”.

Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vxurb10pk9y71.png?width=575&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f96ab1778b831b523496516c34108fc13244e799

As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a ***non-DDIC segment***\*,\* which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for ***AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.***

This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a ***design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application*** (industrial application, from what I gather) – which is ***on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures)****.*

In addition, $HIMX also notes that the ***number of awarded projects*** in this segment is ***growing rapidly***, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical…”to name a few”. ***Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.***

$HIMX also notes “within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company’s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from ***cloud service providers*** who look for ***secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services***”. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like ***smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.***

$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year.

***This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future***\*.\*

**VALUATION &amp; Conclusion**

The chart below compares Himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.

However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers – with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.

The ***average fair value*** on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 – representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.

As for ***transaction comps***, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents ***21x EV/EBITDA*** – which if applied to $HIMX, gives a ***FV of $54/share + 370% upside***\*!\*

***Is $54/share possible here?*** Absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a ***few steps ahead of competition*** with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.

We haven’t even discussed $HIMX’s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long-term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).

***But I’d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game”, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.***

***Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary*** – although, that is probably some time away.

For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.

**Let’s squeeze this one dry. GME X’mas special.**

segment Q HIMX market share Large DDIC Smartphones Tablets note HIMX gt market share Android non iOS tablet quoted across tablet including Apple Automotive OEM So happening recently Himax excellent year HIMX demand consumer electronics spiked also company anticipated significant shortage foundry capacity impacting semiconductor Company realized quite early even covid significant foundry capacity shortage especially specific mature node product HIMX management foresaw historical lack investment mature node combined increasing demand product well new product use exactly mature node would result significant shortage foundry capacity So last year HIMX cosied foundry partner entered long term contract secure additional supply When covid hit early corporates cancelled product order extra foundry capacity came market initially HIMX capitalized opportunity secure even foundry supply Covid blessing disguise HIMX able secure supply enter much better deal significant increase demand end product meant HIMX found sweet spot This gamble paid well demand spiked When many DDIC provider caught pant due lack sufficient foundry supply especially non Taiwanese player HIMX walked full jump suit colourful one This allowed take decent amount market share course last year The graph show significant jump market share Smartphone Tablets segment especially FY amp x B So increase demand management foresaw HIMX management expected see demand increasing higher end version existing product consumer electronics broadly speaking also saw increasing adoption HQ screen new area like Internet Things IoT Automotive vehicle In addition modernisation electrification vehicle EV would boost requirement screen At time slightly unrelated worth mentioning also noted increase adoption would also require chip reduce power consumption significantly This resulted business working option come related product form part Non Driver IC business lot growth potential In word business invested potential diversification away DDICs related product On top increasing demand higher end existing product screen adoption area electrification vehicle etc management also noted unrelated application G high performance computing HPC would also require component use mature node DDIC business used In word HIMX management foresaw increasing demand would come supply shortage started preparing time ago I guess show management excellent Isn adding long term supply time demand spiked risky Will demand persist As mentioned earlier HIMX added market share combination volume existing client well adding new client However HIMX smart entered deal panel maker customer well leading end customer e consumer electronics automotive OEM brand In word increase supply HIMX taking matched increase demand HIMX satisfying demand HIMX taken prepayment deposit customer wanted secure supply component product HIMX foreseeable future So yes demand persist management said demand persist much given clear capacity shortage still experienced industry HIMX inability fulfil order due capacity shortage Now background Supply secured along said demand SHORT SQUEEZE Before going Q result released Thursday th November probably worth mentioning I believe HIMX clear Short Squeeze candidate To every possibility GME round dear friend said given timing opportunity even called GME X ma special So I mention SHORT SQUEEZE well according data th October short interest around share representing float Bloomberg noting day cover However data October I believe short interest increased going earnings Q earnings th November meaning currently short interest likely gt float Lack stock availability mean gt short availability utilization A big short squeeze coming This GME X ma special amp x B With earnings way good result much better expected guidance literally good reason anyone short stock near term let alone fact little availability short anyway give stats borrow availability see chart Currently show k borrow availability IBKR whole lot considering daily volume average around million amp x B As see stock borrow availability quite low We similar level limited availability Jun stock jumped end May high gt intraday th June The increase stock price squeezed short significantly saw stock rally cool odd I think see shortly uncertainty removed could rally much much higher previous high I understand short thesis I really Potential sale decline end consumer demand certain product falling alongside margin pressure foundry HIMX supplier raise price could created perfect doomsday scenario putting huge pressure stock price That good fair thesis The whole short thesis predicated potential reversal performance recent guidance seems suggest otherwise I personally find NO REASON short stock anymore least next month especially given solid guidance We pretty much clarity next quarter full guidance Q decent outlook Q dividend payment July record date usually Jun From I hear mind unconfirmed hearsay much short position held Asian hedge fund increasing short position ahead earnings The short interest jumped share th June dividend record date th October The share price turn collapsed closing price th June low th October But time reversal The Dividend maybe even stock buyback HIMX historically paid EPS dividend For FY HIMX paid IFRS fully diluted EPS dividend paid Jul The average payout since FY FY Fair assume payout IFRS fully diluted EPS continues year So far YTD Q IFRS fully diluted EPS Company recently gave Q guidance Assuming mid point guidance arrive potential fully diluted EPS FY share An payout mean dividend share represents dividend yield given share price today That dear friend crazy cost short The dividend usually declared June paid July time But let face everyone math long institution jump band wagon Now course assuming fund distributed dividend An earlier distribution also likely potentially share buyback Company bought back share previously honest share look ridiculously cheap given performance I put potential stock buyback past company All significant upward pressure price although share already risen last week quite surprise stock rallied much More valuation later end write A question Growth Bros paying dividend mean business grow A common question I get Not many dividend paying business grow like HIMX Understandable But note HIMX DDIC peer fable design house meaning capex light So point worth noting Dividend based EPS net R amp D expense gt reinvestment R amp D spent new product innovation upgrade mostly Reasonably capex light business HIMX fable involve significant amount capex Also HIMX invested significantly R amp D capex FY FY given expectation potential surge demand product Specifically focussed developing new product line upgrading existing product R amp D including spend upgrade existing product line move towards higher quality product range like product K K TVs well focus developing new product non DDIC business Capex including payment secure additional foundry capacity well expansion existing production capability existing product including land purchase In word year pain FY FY effectively investment phase HIMX shareholder enjoying fruit hard earned labour today So performance great massive shareholder distribution coming share price gone Well question still haunt longs name Performance valuation side company reinstated dividend FY performance well Perhaps answer stock predominantly owned traded retail investor However changing hedge fund institution getting involved The chart show change time amp x B Hedge Funds share increased outstanding stock today institutional incl mutual fund ownership increased FY today Note much increase came FY FY performance improved dramatically Much attributed company actively marketing attending conference pitching institution The institutional HF participation set increase opinion Also note founder CEO family owns company So performance getting better institutional ownership improving stock kept pace Well firstly stock climbed significantly since jumped mere share share today The high stock th June price since declined despite performance improving Although share price increased performance much better valuation today still significantly cheaper v peer More valuation end The belief amongst longs MANIPULATION Folks believe stock manipulated Market Makers MMs often option seller HIMX Retail trade option much actively stock giving incentive MMs keep stock price depressed With performance outlook well potential stockholder distribution divi stock buyback side time TAKE BACK CONTROL Q Earnings Now let discus recent earnings Q revenue yoy q q guidance q q Q gross margin v Q v Q guidance Q EBITDA x yoy q q impact operating leverage clearly visible Q Levered FCF bringing YTD FCF The chart show quarterly performance clearly amp x B Charts annual performance incl LTM Sep YTD Sep shown amp x B So Q result came higher end guidance Excellent GUIDANCE positively surprising market Performance going decent However Q guidance market eagerly waiting short keeping close eye Why market waiting guidance Because indication consumer demand TV smartphones fading b panel maker feeling pain e HIMX customer seeing pricing decline c foundry raising price e HIMX supplier raising price Worries around cost increase fading demand would mean mix topline AND margin pressure least short betting Before I go HIMX guidance let say market following panel maker HIMX customer guiding lower volume Q nearest largest competitor Novatek released guidance Thursday th Nov morning stating Q revenue would decline q q Q gross margin would decline registered Q This Novatek guidance better market feared Novatek stock rose Taiwan waiting HIMX report something similar But HIMX KILLED IT Why It reported Q revenue would INCREASE q q Gross margin would fall around reported Q Q IFRS EPS dividend based YTD already v prior year Q e forecast grow roughly x Q non IFRS EPS adjusted non recurring item SBC v prior year Q x roughly Yes margin marginally e foundry raising price one expected growth revenue coming To fair margin increase dilutionary effect cost increase impact HIMX passing price increase customer anyway It simple math CEO explained call He noted original foundry cost HIMX selling price gt gross margin would However foundry raised price HIMX passed customer selling price increased margin would gt dilutionary impact rather pure profitability impact But I said earlier one expected growth revenue coming In word earnings good guidance took market surprise This level surprise best encapsulated question Vertical Group analyst Jon Lopez analyst SELL rating HIMX target expectation bad Q perhaps Mr Lopez question amp x B The answer question pretty much HIMX giving lot lower end business price competition rampant return higher end HQ business get industry recognition company aggressively investing product suite upgrade FY FY b HIMX building relationship top tier brand directly rather going panel maker making demand product defensive Management also alluded proven sale performance v guidance yes specifically mentioned note guidance time different In fact look HIMX historical guidance see company consistently delivered earnings within guidance least last quarter since Q case either higher end guidance beat altogether amp x B So yes CEO Jordan Wu note company history delivering beating guidance shown Let say management highly credible Top line guidance segment Large DDIC GROW high single digit q q helped growth notebook monitor although TV sale drop slightly due softer end market However HIMX remains positive large DDIC given shortage wafer capacity Small amp Mid sized DDIC overall GROW low teen q q gt yoy By sub segment within small amp mid sized DDIC Smartphones gt GROW high teen q q amp gt yoy Tablet gt flat q q Automotive gt GROW double digit q q gt yoy Stalled capacity restricting HIMX ability meet customer demand significant shortage still persists Interestingly within Smartphone segment HIMX mkt share company note undertaking new design development supporting higher frame rate ultra slim bezel higher resolution feature Also importantly successful engagement key customer achieved Q customer indicating interest next launch e winning market share Lots like Automotive HIMX highest growth area hold growing market share Company note increase number size sophistication display inside vehicle evolving rapid rate indicating much DDIC demand per vehicle Not going write extract Q earnings tell everything need know show positive future business within segment amp x B As noted earlier HIMX also non DDIC segment expected decline Q expected significant growth contributor onwards higher margin This segment includes component AR VR amp IoT application This longer term area worth watching adoption increase last quarter HIMX reported design win top tier name mainstream application industrial application I gather track enter mass production Q result visible figure In addition HIMX also note number awarded project segment growing rapidly covering broad range application including notebook home appliance utility meter automotive battery surveillance camera panoramic video conferencing medical name Some application already slated mass production end year meaning see benefit coming HIMX also note within year since HIMX started sampling company WiseEye solution also drawn much attention cloud service provider look secure low power edge AI device help collect big data cloud based service This open new market frontier area like smart city smart office healthcare agriculture retail factory automation HIMX anticipates design win award growing volume shipment starting next year This segment drive lot growth business future VALUATION amp Conclusion The chart compare Himax valuation v peer note competitor division apart DDIC make direct comp However metric LTM basis HIMX screen much cheaper v peer minimum upside Upside using traded comparables representing fair value share v today The average fair value traded comparables HIMX share representing upside v current share price amp x B As transaction comp South Korean DDIC business Magnachip MX US currently subject takeover offer Chinese private equity Wise Road Capital share US government trying stop This offer represents x EV EBITDA applied HIMX give FV share upside Is share possible Absolutely business growing nearest competitor Novatek actually declining This business invested future step ahead competition respect developing new product well upgrading existing product suite building direct relationship end brand We even discussed HIMX potential growth AR VR even mid long term plan nothing

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*TLDR:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company – trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!

&amp;#x200B;

The shares are cheap in a more “normal” S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as \*\*\*stupid cheap\*\*\* with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation

&amp;#x200B;

2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4’21 and even Q1’22, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have \*\*\*consistently delivered results “to guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether\*\*\*\\\*.\\\*

&amp;#x200B;

4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year – representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.

&amp;#x200B;

..and now for the fun bit:

&amp;#x200B;

6. \*\*\*Potential for a significant short squeeze\*\*\*. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were \\\~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to \\\~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.

&amp;#x200B;

The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short – and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a \*\*“\*\*\*\*\*GME X’mas special\*\*\*\*\*”.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

7. Cant confirm this (\*\*\*unconfirmed hearsay\*\*\*) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an \*\*\*Asian hedge fund\*\*\* which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up….. and it has already shot up \\\~15% last couple of weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

Disclosure: I own stock + Jan’22 and Mar’22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan’22 and $10 Mar’22).

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*What does $HIMX do? Products?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here’s a quick snippet of what Himax does:

&amp;#x200B;

$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make ‘panels’ which are, in turn, used in:

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Large sized DDICs\*\*\* \\-&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs\*\*\* \\-&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*High end Timing Controller \*\*\* which improves power efficiency in displays

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*WiseEye ultra power AI\*\*\* \\--&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ \*\*\*AI and ML\*\*\* to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet of Things (IoT) area.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays\*\*\* – with usage in \*\*\*AR/VR glasses\*\*\*, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), \*\*\*Holographic Displays\*\*\*, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Other products\*\*\* in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As a summary – the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Revenue by segment:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) – with Automotive OEM representing \\\~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs \\\~12.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Competitors and Market Shares:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

In the Q3’21 presentation (available \[here\]([https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21\_HIMX-Investor-Presentation\_FInal.pdf](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21_HIMX-Investor-Presentation_FInal.pdf))), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).

&amp;#x200B;

You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As for \*\*\*market share\*\*\* by the individual segments, as of Q3’21, $HIMX’s market shares were:

&amp;#x200B;

\\- Large DDIC: 10.5%

&amp;#x200B;

\\- Smartphones: 10.4%

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Tablets: 37.7%\*\*\* but note that \*\*\*$HIMX has &gt; 60% market share\*\*\* of Android / non iOS tablets – the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Automotive OEM: 32.8%\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*So, what has been happening recently with Himax?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.

&amp;#x200B;

Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products.

&amp;#x200B;

$HIMX management \*\*\*foresaw\*\*\* that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes”, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.

&amp;#x200B;

When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially…. and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX\*\*\* – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX found itself in a very sweet spot.

&amp;#x200B;

This gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked. \*\*\*When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players),\*\*\* \[\*\*\*$HIMX\*\*\*\]([https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;src=cashtag\_click](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;src=cashtag_click)) \*\*\*walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

This allowed it to \*\*\*take a decent amount of market share\*\*\* over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) …..but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like \*\*\*Internet of Things (IoT)\*\*\* and \*\*\*Automotive/vehicles\*\*\*.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, the \*\*\*modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV)\*\*\* would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that \*\*\*this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly\*\*\*. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such \*\*\*5G and high performance computing (HPC)\*\*\* – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its DDIC business used.

&amp;#x200B;

In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for, some time ago.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Isn’t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 – this is from a combination of more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.

&amp;#x200B;

However, $HIMX was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand…. and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.

&amp;#x200B;

$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.

&amp;#x200B;

So yes, for now – the demand will persist, and as management has said, \*\*\*this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage\*\*\*\\\*.\\\*

&amp;#x200B;

Now, that’s the background\\\*\\\*.\\\*\\\* \*\*\*Supply secured along with said demand.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*SHORT SQUEEZE\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear \*\*\*Short Squeeze\*\*\* candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 – and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the “\*\*\*GME X’mas special\*\*\*”.

&amp;#x200B;

So, why do I mention a ‘\*\*\*SHORT SQUEEZE\*\*\*\\\*\\\*’\\\*\\\* – well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest is around 24.7m shares, representing \\\~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting \\\~11 days to cover.

&amp;#x200B;

However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.

&amp;#x200B;

Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of “short availability utilization”. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “\*\*\*GME X’mas special\*\*\*”.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, \*\*\*there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\[[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX)\]([https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX)) gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) – so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun’21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.

&amp;#x200B;

The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. \*\*\*I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

I understand the short-thesis – I really do.

&amp;#x200B;

Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent guidance seems to suggest otherwise.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

I can personally find \*\*\*NO REASON\*\*\* to be short this stock anymore at least for the \*\*\*next 7 months\*\*\*, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4’21 and decent outlook for Q1’22) and then we will have a \*\*\*dividend payment\*\*\* in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*But now, its time for a reversal.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul’21).

&amp;#x200B;

The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been \\\~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.

&amp;#x200B;

So far, YTD Q3’21, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.

&amp;#x200B;

An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a \*\*\*dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July – so we have some time. But let’s face it, everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. \*\*\*An earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Company has bought back shares previously – and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so I wouldn’t put a potential stock buyback past the company.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen \\\~15% over the last few weeks, it’s quite a surprise that the stock hasn’t rallied much more.

&amp;#x200B;

More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*A question from the “Growth Bros”: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

A common question – and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.

&amp;#x200B;

But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light.

&amp;#x200B;

So, 2 points worth noting:

&amp;#x200B;

1. \*\*\*Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is ‘reinvestment\*\*\*\\\*\\\*’\\\*\\\*. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.

2. \*\*\*Reasonably capex-light business\*\*\*: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*R&amp;D\*\*\* – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Capex\*\*\* \\- including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase

&amp;#x200B;

In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their ‘investment phase’, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so, why hasn’t the share price gone up then?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.

&amp;#x200B;

Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20’s performance) as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hedge Funds’ share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 – when performance improved dramatically.

&amp;#x200B;

Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. \*\*\*The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn’t stock kept pace?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.

&amp;#x200B;

Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. \*\*\*More on valuation at the end\*\*\*\\\*\\\*.\\\*\\\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION!\*\*\* Folks believe that this stock is \*\*\*manipulated by Market Makers (MMs)\*\*\* who are often option sellers on $HIMX\\\*\\\*.\\\*\\\* \*\*\*Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed\*\*\*\\\*\\\*.\\\*\\\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it’s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Q3 Earnings\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Now – let’s discuss the recent earnings

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Q3’21 revenue\*\*\*: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Q3’21 gross margin\*\*\*: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2’21 and vs 22.3% in Q3’20 (guidance was 50.5-52%)

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Q3’21 EBITDA\*\*: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here!

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Q3’21 Levered FCF\*\*\* of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.

&amp;#x200B;

The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Charts for annual performance incl LTM Sep’21 and YTD Sep’21 are shown below:

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Why was the market waiting on guidance?\*\*\* Because indications were that:

&amp;#x200B;

(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,

&amp;#x200B;

(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline)

&amp;#x200B;

(c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)

&amp;#x200B;

Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure……or at least that’s what the shorts were betting on.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I go into $HIMX’s guidance, let’s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) – which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4

&amp;#x200B;

\\+

&amp;#x200B;

its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:

&amp;#x200B;

\\- Q4’21 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and

&amp;#x200B;

\\- Q4’21 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.

&amp;#x200B;

This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) – so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Q4 revenue\*\*\* would \*\*\*INCREASE\*\*\* by +4% to +8% q-o-q,

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Gross margin\*\*\*: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Q4 IFRS EPS\*\*\* (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.195 i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Q4 non IFRS EPS\*\*\* (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) \*\*\*but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

To be fair, the \*\*\*margin increase is more of a dilutionary effect\*\*\* than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

“It’s simple math”, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX’s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.

&amp;#x200B;

However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; \*\*\*a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact\*\*\*\\\*.\\\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through.\*\*\* In other words – earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.

&amp;#x200B;

This level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)

&amp;#x200B;

Mr. Lopez’s question is below:

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The answer to this question was pretty much that

&amp;#x200B;

a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (\*the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 – FY19\*), and

&amp;#x200B;

b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’.

&amp;#x200B;

Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “\*\*\*again and again and again\*\*\*” (yes, 3 again’s specifically mentioned) – and notes that guidance this time is no different.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, if you look at $HIMX’s historical guidance, you will see that the company has \*\*\*consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1’17) – and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So yes – as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this “again and again and again”!!! Let’s just say \*\*\*management is highly credible.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Top line guidance by segment:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Large DDIC\*\*\* – to \*\*\*GROW\*\*\* by \*\*\*high single digit q-o-q\*\*\* helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC\*\*\* (overall) – \*\*\*GROW\*\*\* \*\*\*low teens q-o-q\*\*\* and \*\*\*&gt;50% yoy\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Smartphones\*\*\* \\-&gt; \*\*\*GROW\*\*\* \*\*\*high teens q-o-q\*\*\* &amp; \*\*\*&gt;30% yoy\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Tablet\*\*\* \\-&gt; flat q-o-q, and

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Automotive\*\*\* \\-&gt; \*\*\*GROW\*\*\* \*\*\*double-digit q-o-q\*\*\* and \*\*\*&gt;100% yoy\*\*\*. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX’s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.

&amp;#x200B;

Interestingly within the \*\*\*Smartphone\*\*\* segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features”.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, and more importantly \*\*\*“successful engagements with some key customers\*\*\* have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches”. i.e. \*\*\*winning more market share.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Lots to like here.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Automotive\*\*\* is $HIMX’s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share.

&amp;#x200B;

Company notes that the “increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle”.

&amp;#x200B;

Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a \*\*\*non-DDIC segment\*\*\*\\\*,\\\* which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for \*\*\*AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a \*\*\*design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application\*\*\* (industrial application, from what I gather) – which is \*\*\*on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures)\*\*\*\*.\*

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, $HIMX also notes that the \*\*\*number of awarded projects\*\*\* in this segment is \*\*\*growing rapidly\*\*\*, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical…”to name a few”. \*\*\*Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

$HIMX also notes “within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company’s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from \*\*\*cloud service providers\*\*\* who look for \*\*\*secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services\*\*\*”. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like \*\*\*smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future\*\*\*\\\*.\\\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*VALUATION &amp; Conclusion\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

The chart below compares Himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.

&amp;#x200B;

However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers – with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.

&amp;#x200B;

The \*\*\*average fair value\*\*\* on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 – representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As for \*\*\*transaction comps\*\*\*, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents \*\*\*21x EV/EBITDA\*\*\* – which if applied to $HIMX, gives a \*\*\*FV of $54/share + 370% upside\*\*\*\\\*!\\\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Is $54/share possible here?\*\*\* Absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a \*\*\*few steps ahead of competition\*\*\* with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.

&amp;#x200B;

We haven’t even discussed $HIMX’s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long-term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*But I’d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game”, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary\*\*\* – although, that is probably some time away.

&amp;#x200B;

For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Let’s squeeze this one dry. GME X’mas special.\*\*

\[\*\*[www.yieldfanatic.com](https://www.yieldfanatic.com)\*\*\]([https://www.yieldfanatic.com/](https://www.yieldfanatic.com/))",$HIMX - a huge potential play - Extensive DD inside,2,1,"$HIMX - a huge potential play - Extensive DD inside \*\*$HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*TLDR:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company – trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!

&amp;#x200B;

The shares are cheap in a more “normal” S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as \*\*\*stupid cheap\*\*\* with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation

&amp;#x200B;

2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4’21 and even Q1’22, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have \*\*\*consistently delivered results “to guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether\*\*\*\\\*.\\\*

&amp;#x200B;

4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year – representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.

&amp;#x200B;

..and now for the fun bit:

&amp;#x200B;

6. \*\*\*Potential for a significant short squeeze\*\*\*. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were \\\~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to \\\~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.

&amp;#x200B;

The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short – and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a \*\*“\*\*\*\*\*GME X’mas special\*\*\*\*\*”.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

7. Cant confirm this (\*\*\*unconfirmed hearsay\*\*\*) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an \*\*\*Asian hedge fund\*\*\* which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up….. and it has already shot up \\\~15% last couple of weeks.

\*\*What does $HIMX do? Products?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here’s a quick snippet of what Himax does:

&amp;#x200B;

$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make ‘panels’ which are, in turn, used in:

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Large sized DDICs\*\*\* \\-&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs\*\*\* \\-&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*High end Timing Controller \*\*\* which improves power efficiency in displays

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*WiseEye ultra power AI\*\*\* \\--&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ \*\*\*AI and ML\*\*\* to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet of Things (IoT) area.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays\*\*\* – with usage in \*\*\*AR/VR glasses\*\*\*, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), \*\*\*Holographic Displays\*\*\*, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Other products\*\*\* in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As a summary – the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Revenue by segment:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) – with Automotive OEM representing \\\~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs \\\~12.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Competitors and Market Shares:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

In the Q3’21 presentation (available \[here\]([https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21\_HIMX-Investor-Presentation\_FInal.pdf](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21_HIMX-Investor-Presentation_FInal.pdf))), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).

&amp;#x200B;

You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As for \*\*\*market share\*\*\* by the individual segments, as of Q3’21, $HIMX’s market shares were:

&amp;#x200B;

\\- Large DDIC: 10.5%

&amp;#x200B;

\\- Smartphones: 10.4%

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Tablets: 37.7%\*\*\* but note that \*\*\*$HIMX has &gt; 60% market share\*\*\* of Android / non iOS tablets – the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Automotive OEM: 32.8%\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*So, what has been happening recently with Himax?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.

&amp;#x200B;

Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products.

&amp;#x200B;

$HIMX management \*\*\*foresaw\*\*\* that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes”, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.

&amp;#x200B;

When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially…. and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX\*\*\* – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX found itself in a very sweet spot.

&amp;#x200B;

This gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked. \*\*\*When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players),\*\*\* \[\*\*\*$HIMX\*\*\*\]([https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;src=cashtag\_click](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;src=cashtag_click)) \*\*\*walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

This allowed it to \*\*\*take a decent amount of market share\*\*\* over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) …..but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like \*\*\*Internet of Things (IoT)\*\*\* and \*\*\*Automotive/vehicles\*\*\*.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, the \*\*\*modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV)\*\*\* would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that \*\*\*this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly\*\*\*. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such \*\*\*5G and high performance computing (HPC)\*\*\* – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its DDIC business used.

&amp;#x200B;

In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for, some time ago.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Isn’t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 – this is from a combination of more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.

&amp;#x200B;

However, $HIMX was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand…. and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.

&amp;#x200B;

$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.

&amp;#x200B;

So yes, for now – the demand will persist, and as management has said, \*\*\*this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage\*\*\*\\\*.\\\*

&amp;#x200B;

Now, that’s the background\\\*\\\*.\\\*\\\* \*\*\*Supply secured along with said demand.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*SHORT SQUEEZE\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear \*\*\*Short Squeeze\*\*\* candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 – and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the “\*\*\*GME X’mas special\*\*\*”.

&amp;#x200B;

So, why do I mention a ‘\*\*\*SHORT SQUEEZE\*\*\*\\\*\\\*’\\\*\\\* – well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest is around 24.7m shares, representing \\\~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting \\\~11 days to cover.

&amp;#x200B;

However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.

&amp;#x200B;

Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of “short availability utilization”. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “\*\*\*GME X’mas special\*\*\*”.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, \*\*\*there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\[[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX)\]([https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX)) gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) – so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun’21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.

&amp;#x200B;

The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. \*\*\*I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

I understand the short-thesis – I really do.

&amp;#x200B;

Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent guidance seems to suggest otherwise.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

I can personally find \*\*\*NO REASON\*\*\* to be short this stock anymore at least for the \*\*\*next 7 months\*\*\*, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4’21 and decent outlook for Q1’22) and then we will have a \*\*\*dividend payment\*\*\* in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*But now, its time for a reversal.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul’21).

&amp;#x200B;

The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been \\\~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.

&amp;#x200B;

So far, YTD Q3’21, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.

&amp;#x200B;

An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a \*\*\*dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July – so we have some time. But let’s face it, everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. \*\*\*An earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Company has bought back shares previously – and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so I wouldn’t put a potential stock buyback past the company.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen \\\~15% over the last few weeks, it’s quite a surprise that the stock hasn’t rallied much more.

&amp;#x200B;

More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*A question from the “Growth Bros”: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

A common question – and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.

&amp;#x200B;

But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light.

&amp;#x200B;

So, 2 points worth noting:

&amp;#x200B;

1. \*\*\*Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is ‘reinvestment\*\*\*\\\*\\\*’\\\*\\\*. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.

2. \*\*\*Reasonably capex-light business\*\*\*: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*R&amp;D\*\*\* – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Capex\*\*\* \\- including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase

&amp;#x200B;

In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their ‘investment phase’, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so, why hasn’t the share price gone up then?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.

&amp;#x200B;

Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20’s performance) as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hedge Funds’ share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 – when performance improved dramatically.

&amp;#x200B;

Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. \*\*\*The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn’t stock kept pace?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.

&amp;#x200B;

Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. \*\*\*More on valuation at the end\*\*\*\\\*\\\*.\\\*\\\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION!\*\*\* Folks believe that this stock is \*\*\*manipulated by Market Makers (MMs)\*\*\* who are often option sellers on $HIMX\\\*\\\*.\\\*\\\* \*\*\*Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed\*\*\*\\\*\\\*.\\\*\\\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it’s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Q3 Earnings\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Now – let’s discuss the recent earnings

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Q3’21 revenue\*\*\*: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Q3’21 gross margin\*\*\*: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2’21 and vs 22.3% in Q3’20 (guidance was 50.5-52%)

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Q3’21 EBITDA\*\*: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here!

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Q3’21 Levered FCF\*\*\* of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.

&amp;#x200B;

The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Charts for annual performance incl LTM Sep’21 and YTD Sep’21 are shown below:

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Why was the market waiting on guidance?\*\*\* Because indications were that:

&amp;#x200B;

(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,

&amp;#x200B;

(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline)

&amp;#x200B;

(c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)

&amp;#x200B;

Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure……or at least that’s what the shorts were betting on.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I go into $HIMX’s guidance, let’s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) – which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4

&amp;#x200B;

\\+

&amp;#x200B;

its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:

&amp;#x200B;

\\- Q4’21 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and

&amp;#x200B;

\\- Q4’21 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.

&amp;#x200B;

This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) – so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Q4 revenue\*\*\* would \*\*\*INCREASE\*\*\* by +4% to +8% q-o-q,

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Gross margin\*\*\*: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Q4 IFRS EPS\*\*\* (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.195 i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Q4 non IFRS EPS\*\*\* (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) \*\*\*but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

To be fair, the \*\*\*margin increase is more of a dilutionary effect\*\*\* than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

“It’s simple math”, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX’s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.

&amp;#x200B;

However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; \*\*\*a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact\*\*\*\\\*.\\\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through.\*\*\* In other words – earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.

&amp;#x200B;

This level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)

&amp;#x200B;

Mr. Lopez’s question is below:

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The answer to this question was pretty much that

&amp;#x200B;

a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (\*the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 – FY19\*), and

&amp;#x200B;

b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’.

&amp;#x200B;

Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “\*\*\*again and again and again\*\*\*” (yes, 3 again’s specifically mentioned) – and notes that guidance this time is no different.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, if you look at $HIMX’s historical guidance, you will see that the company has \*\*\*consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1’17) – and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So yes – as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this “again and again and again”!!! Let’s just say \*\*\*management is highly credible.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Top line guidance by segment:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Large DDIC\*\*\* – to \*\*\*GROW\*\*\* by \*\*\*high single digit q-o-q\*\*\* helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC\*\*\* (overall) – \*\*\*GROW\*\*\* \*\*\*low teens q-o-q\*\*\* and \*\*\*&gt;50% yoy\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Smartphones\*\*\* \\-&gt; \*\*\*GROW\*\*\* \*\*\*high teens q-o-q\*\*\* &amp; \*\*\*&gt;30% yoy\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Tablet\*\*\* \\-&gt; flat q-o-q, and

&amp;#x200B;

\\- \*\*\*Automotive\*\*\* \\-&gt; \*\*\*GROW\*\*\* \*\*\*double-digit q-o-q\*\*\* and \*\*\*&gt;100% yoy\*\*\*. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX’s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.

&amp;#x200B;

Interestingly within the \*\*\*Smartphone\*\*\* segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features”.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, and more importantly \*\*\*“successful engagements with some key customers\*\*\* have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches”. i.e. \*\*\*winning more market share.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Lots to like here.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Automotive\*\*\* is $HIMX’s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share.

&amp;#x200B;

Company notes that the “increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle”.

&amp;#x200B;

Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a \*\*\*non-DDIC segment\*\*\*\\\*,\\\* which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for \*\*\*AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a \*\*\*design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application\*\*\* (industrial application, from what I gather) – which is \*\*\*on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures)\*\*\*\*.\*

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, $HIMX also notes that the \*\*\*number of awarded projects\*\*\* in this segment is \*\*\*growing rapidly\*\*\*, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical…”to name a few”. \*\*\*Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

$HIMX also notes “within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company’s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from \*\*\*cloud service providers\*\*\* who look for \*\*\*secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services\*\*\*”. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like \*\*\*smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future\*\*\*\\\*.\\\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*VALUATION &amp; Conclusion\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

The chart below compares Himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.

&amp;#x200B;

However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers – with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.

&amp;#x200B;

The \*\*\*average fair value\*\*\* on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 – representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As for \*\*\*transaction comps\*\*\*, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents \*\*\*21x EV/EBITDA\*\*\* – which if applied to $HIMX, gives a \*\*\*FV of $54/share + 370% upside\*\*\*\\\*!\\\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Is $54/share possible here?\*\*\* Absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a \*\*\*few steps ahead of competition\*\*\* with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.

&amp;#x200B;

We haven’t even discussed $HIMX’s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long-term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*But I’d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game”, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary\*\*\* – although, that is probably some time away.

&amp;#x200B;

For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Let’s squeeze this one dry. GME X’mas special.\*\*

1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company – trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!

The shares are cheap in a more “normal” S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as ***stupid cheap*** with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation

2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.

3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4’21 and even Q1’22, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have ***consistently delivered results “to guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether***\*.\*

4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year – representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.

5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.

..and now for the fun bit:

6. ***Potential for a significant short squeeze***. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were \~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to \~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.

The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short – and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a **“*****GME X’mas special*****”.**

7. Cant confirm this (***unconfirmed hearsay***) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an ***Asian hedge fund*** which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up….. and it has already shot up \~15% last couple of weeks.

Disclosure: I own stock + Jan’22 and Mar’22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan’22 and $10 Mar’22).

**What does $HIMX do? Products?**

Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here’s a quick snippet of what Himax does:

$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make ‘panels’ which are, in turn, used in:

\- ***Large sized DDICs*** \-&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc

\- ***Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs*** \-&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xauvd0foi9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f100091008d982b11365eddb2f01cd44c01162e

In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:

\- ***High end Timing Controller (TCON)*** which improves power efficiency in displays

\- ***WiseEye ultra power AI*** \--&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ ***AI and ML*** to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet of Things (IoT) area.

**Revenue by segment:**

Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) – with Automotive OEM representing \~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs \~12.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

***However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.***

The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.

**Competitors and Market Shares:**

In the Q3’21 presentation (available [here](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21_HIMX-Investor-Presentation_FInal.pdf)), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).

You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.

As for ***market share*** by the individual segments, as of Q3’21, $HIMX’s market shares were:

\- Large DDIC: 10.5%

\- Smartphones: 10.4%

\- ***Tablets: 37.7%*** but note that ***$HIMX has &gt; 60% market share*** of Android / non iOS tablets – the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.

\- ***Automotive OEM: 32.8%***

**So, what has been happening recently with Himax?**

2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.

Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products.

$HIMX management ***foresaw*** that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes”, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.

When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially…. and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.

***Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX*** – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX found itself in a very sweet spot.

This gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked. ***When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players),*** [***$HIMX***](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;src=cashtag_click) ***walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!***

This allowed it to ***take a decent amount of market share*** over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dy2osq4ti9y71.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7471bbecf7cdbbeae78af1c495e4dfc1c18cca08

**So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?**

$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) …..but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like ***Internet of Things (IoT)*** and ***Automotive/vehicles***.

In addition, the ***modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV)*** would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that ***this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly***. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.

On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such ***5G and high performance computing (HPC)*** – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its DDIC business used.

In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for, some time ago.

***I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.***

**Isn’t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?**

As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 – this is from a combination of more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.

However, $HIMX was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand…. and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.

$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.

So yes, for now – the demand will persist, and as management has said, ***this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage***\*.\*

Now, that’s the background\*\*.\*\* ***Supply secured along with said demand.***

**SHORT SQUEEZE**

Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear ***Short Squeeze*** candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 – and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the “***GME X’mas special***”.

So, why do I mention a ‘***SHORT SQUEEZE***\*\*’\*\* – well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest is around 24.7m shares, representing \~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting \~11 days to cover.

However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.

Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of “short availability utilization”. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “***GME X’mas special***”.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9f23hvtti9y71.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7dfbd7e3f672ab3504d82035e0e479551ac7b02

With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, ***there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.***

[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX) gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) – so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3idfre8ui9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d4484efc50e8d9e3660213ecfcb05b2a828fbe2

As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun’21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.

The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. ***I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs.***

I understand the short-thesis – I really do.

Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.

***The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent guidance seems to suggest otherwise.***

I can personally find ***NO REASON*** to be short this stock anymore at least for the ***next 7 months***, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4’21 and decent outlook for Q1’22) and then we will have a ***dividend payment*** in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).

***From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.***

The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.

***But now, its time for a reversal.***

**The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)**

$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul’21).

The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been \~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.

So far, YTD Q3’21, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.

An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a ***dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!***

***That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.***

The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July – so we have some time. But let’s face it, everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.

Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. ***An earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks.***

Company has bought back shares previously – and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so I wouldn’t put a potential stock buyback past the company.

All in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen \~15% over the last few weeks, it’s quite a surprise that the stock hasn’t rallied much more.

More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).

**A question from the “Growth Bros”: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?**

A common question – and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.

But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light.

So, 2 points worth noting:

1. ***Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is ‘reinvestment***\*\*’\*\*. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
2. ***Reasonably capex-light business***: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.

Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

\- ***R&amp;D*** – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and

\- ***Capex*** \- including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase

In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their ‘investment phase’, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.

**So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so, why hasn’t the share price gone up then?**

Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.

Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20’s performance) as well.

Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/06tfb03vi9y71.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ca55057da0a7bbce8c10570cbf3b69f98cac9a8

Hedge Funds’ share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 – when performance improved dramatically.

Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. ***The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.***

Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.

**So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn’t stock kept pace?**

Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.

Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. ***More on valuation at the end***\*\*.\*\*

***The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION!*** Folks believe that this stock is ***manipulated by Market Makers (MMs)*** who are often option sellers on $HIMX\*\*.\*\* ***Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed***\*\*.\*\*

**With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it’s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!**

**Q3 Earnings**

Now – let’s discuss the recent earnings

***Q3’21 revenue***: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)

***Q3’21 gross margin***: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2’21 and vs 22.3% in Q3’20 (guidance was 50.5-52%)

**Q3’21 EBITDA**: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here!

***Q3’21 Levered FCF*** of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.

The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.

***So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.***

**GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market**

Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.

***Why was the market waiting on guidance?*** Because indications were that:

(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,

(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline)

(c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)

Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure……or at least that’s what the shorts were betting on.

Before I go into $HIMX’s guidance, let’s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) – which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4

\+

its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:

\- Q4’21 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and

\- Q4’21 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.

This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) – so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.

***But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:***

\- ***Q4 revenue*** would ***INCREASE*** by +4% to +8% q-o-q,

\- ***Gross margin***: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)

\- ***Q4 IFRS EPS*** (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.195 i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!

\- ***Q4 non IFRS EPS*** (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)

Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) ***but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!***

To be fair, the ***margin increase is more of a dilutionary effect*** than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.

“It’s simple math”, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX’s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.

However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; ***a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact***\*.\*

***But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through.*** In other words – earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.

This level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)

Mr. Lopez’s question is below:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zvps6kwwi9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1b237c9ee9fb86a957c78f5298eba51ac76f8fd

The answer to this question was pretty much that

a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (*the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 – FY19*), and

b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’.

Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “***again and again and again***” (yes, 3 again’s specifically mentioned) – and notes that guidance this time is no different.

In fact, if you look at $HIMX’s historical guidance, you will see that the company has ***consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1’17) – and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.***

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/got3rshxi9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5f649c842415a00feebddadb2d9d725450fc5f8

So yes – as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this “again and again and again”!!! Let’s just say ***management is highly credible.***

**Top line guidance by segment:**

\- ***Large DDIC*** – to ***GROW*** by ***high single digit q-o-q*** helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.

\- ***Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC*** (overall) – ***GROW*** ***low teens q-o-q*** and ***&gt;50% yoy***

By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:

\- ***Smartphones*** \-&gt; ***GROW*** ***high teens q-o-q*** &amp; ***&gt;30% yoy***

\- ***Tablet*** \-&gt; flat q-o-q, and

\- ***Automotive*** \-&gt; ***GROW*** ***double-digit q-o-q*** and ***&gt;100% yoy***. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX’s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.

Interestingly within the ***Smartphone*** segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features”.

Also, and more importantly ***“successful engagements with some key customers*** have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches”. i.e. ***winning more market share.***

***Lots to like here.***

***Automotive*** is $HIMX’s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share.

Company notes that the “increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle”.

Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.

&amp;#x200B;

As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a ***non-DDIC segment***\*,\* which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for ***AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.***

This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a ***design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application*** (industrial application, from what I gather) – which is ***on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures)****.*

In addition, $HIMX also notes that the ***number of awarded projects*** in this segment is ***growing rapidly***, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical…”to name a few”. ***Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.***

$HIMX also notes “within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company’s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from ***cloud service providers*** who look for ***secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services***”. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like ***smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.***

$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year.

***This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future***\*.\*

**VALUATION &amp; Conclusion**

The chart below compares Himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.

However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers – with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.

The ***average fair value*** on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 – representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.

As for ***transaction comps***, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents ***21x EV/EBITDA*** – which if applied to $HIMX, gives a ***FV of $54/share + 370% upside***\*!\*

***Is $54/share possible here?*** Absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a ***few steps ahead of competition*** with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.

We haven’t even discussed $HIMX’s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long-term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).

***But I’d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game”, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.***

***Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary*** – although, that is probably some time away.

For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.

**$HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present.**

**TLDR:**

1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company – trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!

The shares are cheap in a more “normal” S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as ***stupid cheap*** with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation

2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.

3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4’21 and even Q1’22, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have ***consistently delivered results “to guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether***\*.\*

4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year – representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.

5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.

..and now for the fun bit:

6. ***Potential for a significant short squeeze***. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were \~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to \~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.

The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short – and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a **“*****GME X’mas special*****”.**

7. Cant confirm this (***unconfirmed hearsay***) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an ***Asian hedge fund*** which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up….. and it has already shot up \~15% last couple of weeks.

Disclosure: I own stock + Jan’22 and Mar’22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan’22 and $10 Mar’22).

**What does $HIMX do? Products?**

Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here’s a quick snippet of what Himax does:

$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make ‘panels’ which are, in turn, used in:

\- ***Large sized DDICs*** \-&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc

\- ***Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs*** \-&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:

\- ***High end Timing Controller (TCON)*** which improves power efficiency in displays

\- ***WiseEye ultra power AI*** \--&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ ***AI and ML*** to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet of Things (IoT) area.

**Revenue by segment:**

Revenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) – with Automotive OEM representing \~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs \~12.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

***However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.***

The Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.

**Competitors and Market Shares:**

In the Q3’21 presentation (available [here](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21_HIMX-Investor-Presentation_FInal.pdf)), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).

You may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.

As for ***market share*** by the individual segments, as of Q3’21, $HIMX’s market shares were:

\- Large DDIC: 10.5%

\- Smartphones: 10.4%

\- ***Tablets: 37.7%*** but note that ***$HIMX has &gt; 60% market share*** of Android / non iOS tablets – the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.

\- ***Automotive OEM: 32.8%***

**So, what has been happening recently with Himax?**

2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.

Company realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products.

$HIMX management ***foresaw*** that this historical lack of investment in ""mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes”, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.

When covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially…. and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.

***Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX*** – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX found itself in a very sweet spot.

This gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked. ***When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players),*** [***$HIMX***](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;src=cashtag_click) ***walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!***

This allowed it to ***take a decent amount of market share*** over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dy2osq4ti9y71.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7471bbecf7cdbbeae78af1c495e4dfc1c18cca08

**So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?**

$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) …..but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like ***Internet of Things (IoT)*** and ***Automotive/vehicles***.

In addition, the ***modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV)*** would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that ***this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly***. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.

On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such ***5G and high performance computing (HPC)*** – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its DDIC business used.

In other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for, some time ago.

***I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.***

**Isn’t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?**

As mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 – this is from a combination of more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.

However, $HIMX was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand…. and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.

$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.

So yes, for now – the demand will persist, and as management has said, ***this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage***\*.\*

Now, that’s the background\*\*.\*\* ***Supply secured along with said demand.***

**SHORT SQUEEZE**

Before going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear ***Short Squeeze*** candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 – and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the “***GME X’mas special***”.

So, why do I mention a ‘***SHORT SQUEEZE***\*\*’\*\* – well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest is around 24.7m shares, representing \~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting \~11 days to cover.

However, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.

Lack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of “short availability utilization”. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “***GME X’mas special***”.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9f23hvtti9y71.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7dfbd7e3f672ab3504d82035e0e479551ac7b02

With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, ***there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.***

[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX) gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) – so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3idfre8ui9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d4484efc50e8d9e3660213ecfcb05b2a828fbe2

As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun’21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.

The increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. ***I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs.***

I understand the short-thesis – I really do.

Potential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.

***The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent guidance seems to suggest otherwise.***

I can personally find ***NO REASON*** to be short this stock anymore at least for the ***next 7 months***, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4’21 and decent outlook for Q1’22) and then we will have a ***dividend payment*** in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).

***From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.***

The short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.

***But now, its time for a reversal.***

**The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)**

$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul’21).

The average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been \~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.

So far, YTD Q3’21, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.

An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a ***dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!***

***That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.***

The dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July – so we have some time. But let’s face it, everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.

Now, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. ***An earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks.***

Company has bought back shares previously – and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so I wouldn’t put a potential stock buyback past the company.

All in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen \~15% over the last few weeks, it’s quite a surprise that the stock hasn’t rallied much more.

More on valuation later (at the end of the write up).

**A question from the “Growth Bros”: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?**

A common question – and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.

But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light.

So, 2 points worth noting:

1. ***Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is ‘reinvestment***\*\*’\*\*. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.
2. ***Reasonably capex-light business***: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.

Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.

\- ***R&amp;D*** – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and

\- ***Capex*** \- including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase

In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their ‘investment phase’, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.

**So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so, why hasn’t the share price gone up then?**

Well, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.

Performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20’s performance) as well.

Perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/06tfb03vi9y71.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ca55057da0a7bbce8c10570cbf3b69f98cac9a8

Hedge Funds’ share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 – when performance improved dramatically.

Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. ***The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.***

Also note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.

**So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn’t stock kept pace?**

Well, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.

Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. ***More on valuation at the end***\*\*.\*\*

***The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION!*** Folks believe that this stock is ***manipulated by Market Makers (MMs)*** who are often option sellers on $HIMX\*\*.\*\* ***Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed***\*\*.\*\*

**With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it’s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!**

**Q3 Earnings**

Now – let’s discuss the recent earnings

***Q3’21 revenue***: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)

***Q3’21 gross margin***: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2’21 and vs 22.3% in Q3’20 (guidance was 50.5-52%)

**Q3’21 EBITDA**: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here!

***Q3’21 Levered FCF*** of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.

The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.

***So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.***

**GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market**

Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.

***Why was the market waiting on guidance?*** Because indications were that:

(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,

(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline)

(c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)

Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure……or at least that’s what the shorts were betting on.

Before I go into $HIMX’s guidance, let’s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) – which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4

\+

its nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:

\- Q4’21 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and

\- Q4’21 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.

This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) – so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.

***But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:***

\- ***Q4 revenue*** would ***INCREASE*** by +4% to +8% q-o-q,

\- ***Gross margin***: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)

\- ***Q4 IFRS EPS*** (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.195 i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!

\- ***Q4 non IFRS EPS*** (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)

Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) ***but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!***

To be fair, the ***margin increase is more of a dilutionary effect*** than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.

“It’s simple math”, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX’s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.

However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; ***a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact***\*.\*

***But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through.*** In other words – earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.

This level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)

Mr. Lopez’s question is below:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zvps6kwwi9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1b237c9ee9fb86a957c78f5298eba51ac76f8fd

The answer to this question was pretty much that

a) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (*the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 – FY19*), and

b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’.

Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “***again and again and again***” (yes, 3 again’s specifically mentioned) – and notes that guidance this time is no different.

In fact, if you look at $HIMX’s historical guidance, you will see that the company has ***consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1’17) – and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.***

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/got3rshxi9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5f649c842415a00feebddadb2d9d725450fc5f8

So yes – as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this “again and again and again”!!! Let’s just say ***management is highly credible.***

**Top line guidance by segment:**

\- ***Large DDIC*** – to ***GROW*** by ***high single digit q-o-q*** helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.

\- ***Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC*** (overall) – ***GROW*** ***low teens q-o-q*** and ***&gt;50% yoy***

By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:

\- ***Smartphones*** \-&gt; ***GROW*** ***high teens q-o-q*** &amp; ***&gt;30% yoy***

\- ***Tablet*** \-&gt; flat q-o-q, and

\- ***Automotive*** \-&gt; ***GROW*** ***double-digit q-o-q*** and ***&gt;100% yoy***. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX’s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.

Interestingly within the ***Smartphone*** segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features”.

Also, and more importantly ***“successful engagements with some key customers*** have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches”. i.e. ***winning more market share.***

***Lots to like here.***

***Automotive*** is $HIMX’s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share.

Company notes that the “increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle”.

Not going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.

&amp;#x200B;

As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a ***non-DDIC segment***\*,\* which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for ***AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.***

This is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a ***design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application*** (industrial application, from what I gather) – which is ***on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures)****.*

In addition, $HIMX also notes that the ***number of awarded projects*** in this segment is ***growing rapidly***, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical…”to name a few”. ***Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.***

$HIMX also notes “within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company’s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from ***cloud service providers*** who look for ***secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services***”. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like ***smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.***

$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year.

***This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future***\*.\*

**VALUATION &amp; Conclusion**

The chart below compares Himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.

However, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers – with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.

The ***average fair value*** on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 – representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.

As for ***transaction comps***, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents ***21x EV/EBITDA*** – which if applied to $HIMX, gives a ***FV of $54/share + 370% upside***\*!\*

***Is $54/share possible here?*** Absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a ***few steps ahead of competition*** with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.

We haven’t even discussed $HIMX’s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long-term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).

***But I’d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game”, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.***

***Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary*** – although, that is probably some time away.

For now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.

**Let’s squeeze this one dry. GME X’mas special.**

Salutations fellow ape family this is my first fundamental analysis drop, my ape family has inspired me to share my knowledge with you all. If I am successful I want to share my insights with my ape family.

With that being said welcome to my ted talk, there has been a lot going on during the pandemic and there are a lot of ways to profit; I myself am a poor smooth brained autist but this ape has seen some light. There have been some serious discussions about people refusing to take the vaccine and individuals looking for alternatives there is a divide amongst Americans whether or not to take the COVID vaccine. With all do respect everyone has the right to make a choice to live or die based off whatever they believe. I as an engineer see a problem and look for a solution, and this is what any scientist would do and of course look for a profit based off peoples wants and needs. So I introduce to you all Viatris (VTRS). VTRS was formerly known as Mylan N.V. was a global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company. In November 2020, Mylan merged with Upjohn, Pfizer's off-patent medicine division, to form Viatris. Viatris, Inc. is a global healthcare company, which engages in the provision of access to medicines, sustainable operations. It also offers support services such as diagnostic clinics, educational seminars, and digital tools. The firm operates through the following segments: Developed Markets, Greater China, JANZ, and Emerging Markets. The Developed Markets segment comprises operations primarily in North America and Europe. The Greater China segment includes operations in mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. The JANZ segment consists of operations in Japan, Australia and New Zealand. The Emerging Markets segment encompasses operations with developing markets and emerging economies including countries in Asia, the Middle East, South and Central America, Africa and Eastern Europe. Okay so basically this company is all around the fucking world fellow apes so why the fook am I making such a Donkey Kong big deal…

Well I’m here for you  brethren to connect some motherfookin tendies to all yall. Okay so just recently Pfizer (PFE) has come out with a COVID pill an antiviral that cuts the risk of hospitalization or death by 89% for vulnerable people newly diagnosed with COVID-19. The news I am presenting to you my family is big… we are slowly connecting the dots here bear with  me, I do hope you are enjoying the read though I love you all.

I have linked supporting articles that explain more about the pill I will allow you apes to dig deeper for yourselves…

Alright let’s start connecting these dots… so VTRS operates all around the world literally all around the fookin world, PFE made a pill to treat COVID and VTRS operates all around the world, for those who are unwilling to take a vaccine to save their lives they can simply take a pill… are you apes connecting the dots with me. So if PFE makes a pill what better way to distribute this pill than with VTRS since it already operates all around the world. Yeah that’s right you heard correctly PFE researches the pill VTRS distributes the pill for PFE. I hope this makes sense to you all I encourage you all to do your own research too. Me right now I’m too broke to purchase stock, this shit is way too pricy for my taste. Right now VTRS is trading at $14.56 a share yeah too expensive for my taste, but you know what is not expensive the buy call options… yeah, if I got to learn anything from DeepFuckingValue is that theta decay (time) is either your friend or your enemy. What do I mean you need time for your crop to bear fruit. So what do you think the value of VTRS could be… personally I think it is way undervalued. Yes 14.56 well for me anyways is a lot personally but I believe this shit is going to moon hard. I try to look for the biggest bang for my buck right now you can get a contract that expires Jan 2023 for 10¢ a share that’s $10 for a “lot” meaning 100 shares. 100 contracts for $1,000 isn’t a bad deal. Personally I can’t afford that many but I was able to pick up a quarter of the amount. PFE is trading at about $50 a share at the moment it will probably go to the moon too. But I can’t afford that shit either but I can afford the distributor. I mean to put things into perspective Moderna MRNA was one of the first ones to get approval for a vaccine and the stock went from $20 a share to $450. Okay now lets look at short interest apes lets look under the hood of this baby, I’m using marketbeat it is identified on 10/15/2021 the short interest was at 28,450,000 shares this represents

$17,480,000,000 (market  cap)/$14.56(share price) = 1200549450.55 (available shares)

28,450,000 (SI) /1200549450.55  (available shares) = 0.02369748283 (SI of float)

0.02369748283 (SI of float) \* 100 = 2.369% (SI of float percentage)

The short interest low and personally, I think a short on this stock is an attack not only nefarious but an attack on all human kind.

If we take a  look at the company’s history we can see that it is at historical all time lows which for me this presents a perfect opportunity to capitalize on all time lows for an opportunity to make gains on historical all time highs because of PFE’s revolutionary COVID pill.

My personal opinion take it for a grain of salt; PFE and VTRS will do the same rocket hard. If you don’t want a vaccine fine take a pill.

TL;DR

VTRS go moon; options contracts inexpensive

Options Contracts selling for 10¢ a “lot” for expiry of Jan 2023

From an operations standpoint, the company has done horribly as well. For example, Revenue for FY17 was $881mm and was $461mm in FY20, a substantial reduction. During that same time, the company has been consistently losing money and burning through cash at an alarming rate. See picture below for a snapshot of financials.

Despite the substantial reduction, the company’s cash burn and revenue loss has seemed to stabilize significantly, with Blue Apron only burning $46mm in FY 2020, representing a 4 year CAGR of 31.52% in the reduction of their total net loss. In addition to this, Revenue was flat from 2019-2020 and actually grew 13% Year-over-Year if you’re using the Last Twelve Months as of June 30th (LTM), instead of just FY20.

I also believe given that there is only 1 analyst who provides forward estimates, and the sudden impact of Covid-19 and changing trends, the company may also be covered (as management potentially indicated on Canaccord call) and lose much less money than currently predicted by the street (already hit profitability in Q2 2020). No one knows what the future of covid will be like, but we know for a certain people are looking to save more money and avoid crowded situations (especially the elderly).

Now I believe covid-19 has fundamentally changed the entire landscape of the meal-kit / food delivery businesses and Blue Apron, from an operations standpoint, can only improve from here. People are saving more money, many moving out of cities where restaurant options are more limited, and many simply just want to stay home more often instead of going out all the time. Despite the entrance of several competitors in the space (hellofresh, marley spoon &amp; others), I believe the addressable market is ginormous here, and the pie can be shared by many. **The company also literally trades at a fraction of its revenue (\~0.4x LTM EV/Sales;), well below comps like HelloFresh which trades at 2.6x LTM EV/Sales and 26.8x LTM EV/EBIT (650% upside off the revenue multiple, $52 per share).** Although HelloFresh has a significant net cash balance and much stronger track record since IPO, it offers insight into what Blue Apron could be valued at if this thing turns around and becomes profitable (also keep in mind HelloFresh is not listed on a US main exchange, which implies APRN valuation could be higher than that in a major turnaround case). Even trading at revenue would imply 200% upside here (also not adjusting for new cap raise, rights offering conducted in October).

Blue Apron has also introduced several new product lines that are helping to raise average order value and gain new customers, including customization, a premium service, and a new wine subscription service. They offer weekly menus of restaurant-quality food for much cheaper prices than going out and are constantly adding new specials such as “Butcher Bundles” and “Craft Burger” menu options. Go look at the website, the food looks incredible. It’s a solid balance from wanting a good meal, not wanting to pay up at a restaurant, or not wanting to cook for 1.5 hours while following a recipe step by step and hoping to not mess it up. In addition to this, famous chefs are partnering with the company to add their dishes to the menu, which offers a very strong growth opportunity as the kitchen for delivery or ghost kitchen business takes off and allows chefs to distribute their recipes to much wider audiences than they have done before.

Another positive development was the announcement that Matthew Salzberg, the company’s co-founder and board chair, and Barry Salzberg, have resigned from the company’s board of directors. This is great news as the company performed terribly under their watch, and signals to investors that there is a fundamental change going on at Blue Apron, and better times are ahead. **The company also changed its multiclass voting structure in agreement with Matthew Salzberg, Berry Salzberg and Joseph Sanberg. There now will only be one class of common stock outstanding, Class A common stock. Before the change, there was also a Class B common stock, which entitled holders to 10 votes per share, instead of 1 vote per share that Class A holders have.** This also emphasizes the fundamental change going on here and signaling to investors the company is turning itself around and becoming more shareholder friendly. The conducting of the rights offering (which is relatively rare in the U.S. at least), is also signaling a different approach the company is taking, and a real effort to create value using the best methods possible (rights offerings give existing shareholders the right to not be diluted when raising capital).

There is a lot more to the story and I encourage you to do your own due diligence.

In addition to this, famous chefs are partnering with the company to add their dishes to the menu, which offers a very strong growth opportunity as the kitchen for delivery or ghost kitchen business takes off and allows chefs to distribute their recipes to much wider audiences than they have done before. 

Another positive development was the announcement that Matthew Salzberg, the company’s co-founder and board chair, and Barry Salzberg, have resigned from the company’s board of directors. This is great news as the company performed terribly under their watch, and signals to investors that there is a fundamental change going on at Blue Apron, and better times are ahead. **The company also changed its multiclass voting structure in agreement with Matthew Salzberg, Berry Salzberg and Joseph Sanberg. There now will only be one class of common stock outstanding, Class A common stock. Before the change, there was also a Class B common stock, which entitled holders to 10 votes per share, instead of 1 vote per share that Class A holders have.** This also emphasizes the fundamental change going on here and signaling to investors the company is turning itself around and becoming more shareholder friendly. The conducting of the rights offering (which is relatively rare in the U.S. at least), is also signaling a different approach the company is taking, and a real effort to create value using the best methods possible (rights offerings give existing shareholders the right to not be diluted when raising capital). 

There is a lot more to the story and I encourage you to do your own due diligence. However, I think this ship is turning around big time, and the tailwinds from covid will eventually turn this company into a cash generating machine (high margin given bulk ordering before SG&amp;A). Last night walking in New York I saw several Blue Apron packages on the side of street, right after I began writing this article. So I don’t know if the stonk market gods are at play or the service is genuinely getting more popular (even amongst the urban elite), but I have never seen a blue apron box in NYC before. You can try to predict revenue and price targets all you want, but all I know is this thing is going to the moon. Don’t miss out.",Why Blue Apron (APRN) is being slept and why it will go to $15+ per share very soon,1,1,"Why Blue Apron (APRN) is being slept and why it will go to $15+ per share very soon If you’ve been following Blue Apron since its IPO in 2017, you know its been an unmitigated disaster. To give some perspective on how bad it’s been crushed, the company IPO’d at a valuation of nearly $2 billion, and is now only worth $200mm, 10% of its initial value at the IPO. It was also a high profile, over-hyped IPO and set insanely high expectations for itself. Despite being absolutely cucked since IPO, I believe Blue Apron is an incredible buy at these prices and will go to the moon very shortly.

From an operations standpoint, the company has done horribly as well. For example, Revenue for FY17 was $881mm and was $461mm in FY20, a substantial reduction. During that same time, the company has been consistently losing money and burning through cash at an alarming rate. See picture below for a snapshot of financials. 

📷

Despite the substantial reduction, the company’s cash burn and revenue loss has seemed to stabilize significantly, with Blue Apron only burning $46mm in FY 2020, representing a 4 year CAGR of 31.52% in the reduction of their total net loss. In addition to this, Revenue was flat from 2019-2020 and actually grew 13% Year-over-Year if you’re using the Last Twelve Months as of June 30th (LTM), instead of just FY20. 

**In addition to this, the company has $51mm in cash to cover losses in the next few years, which does not include the recently announced $78mm capital raise (which includes a $45mm fully backstopped rights offering, $30mm private placement with Joseph N. Sanberg and $3mm private placement with co-founder Matthew Salzburg), which would put the total cash balance at \~$129mm (net cash of $62.5mm).** Although this may not be enough and may warrant another capital raise, it provides a very strong buffer until they can achieve and sustain profitability ($27.9mm additional burn expected in FY21, $39.4mm in FY22, and $25.6mm in FY23 \[$92.9mm total\]). I also believe given that there is only 1 analyst who provides forward estimates, and the sudden impact of Covid-19 and changing trends, the company may also be covered (as management potentially indicated on Canaccord call) and lose much less money than currently predicted by the street (already hit profitability in Q2 2020). No one knows what the future of covid will be like, but we know for a certain people are looking to save more money and avoid crowded situations (especially the elderly).  

Now I believe covid-19 has fundamentally changed the entire landscape of the meal-kit / food delivery businesses and Blue Apron, from an operations standpoint, can only improve from here. People are saving more money, many moving out of cities where restaurant options are more limited, and many simply just want to stay home more often instead of going out all the time.  Despite the entrance of several competitors in the space (hellofresh, marley spoon &amp; others), I believe the addressable market is ginormous here, and the pie can be shared by many. **The company also literally trades at a fraction of its revenue (\~0.4x LTM EV/Sales;), well below comps like HelloFresh which trades at 2.6x LTM EV/Sales and 26.8x LTM EV/EBIT (650% upside off the revenue multiple, $52 per share).** Although HelloFresh has a significant net cash balance and much stronger track record since IPO, it offers insight into what Blue Apron could be valued at if this thing turns around and becomes profitable (also keep in mind HelloFresh is not listed on a US main exchange, which implies APRN valuation could be higher than that in a major turnaround case). Even trading at revenue would imply 200% upside here (also not adjusting for new cap raise, rights offering conducted in October).  

Blue Apron has also introduced several new product lines that are helping to raise average order value and gain new customers, including customization, a premium service, and a new wine subscription service. They offer weekly menus of restaurant-quality food for much cheaper prices than going out and are constantly adding new specials such as “Butcher Bundles” and “Craft Burger” menu options. Go look at the website, the food looks incredible. It’s a solid balance from wanting a good meal, not wanting to pay up at a restaurant, or not wanting to cook for 1.5 hours while following a recipe step by step and hoping to not mess it up. In addition to this, famous chefs are partnering with the company to add their dishes to the menu, which offers a very strong growth opportunity as the kitchen for delivery or ghost kitchen business takes off and allows chefs to distribute their recipes to much wider audiences than they have done before.

There now will only be one class of common stock outstanding, Class A common stock. Before the change, there was also a Class B common stock, which entitled holders to 10 votes per share, instead of 1 vote per share that Class A holders have.** This also emphasizes the fundamental change going on here and signaling to investors the company is turning itself around and becoming more shareholder friendly. The conducting of the rights offering (which is relatively rare in the U.S. at least), is also signaling a different approach the company is taking, and a real effort to create value using the best methods possible (rights offerings give existing shareholders the right to not be diluted when raising capital).

**Category - Digital Retail** 

**Macro - Mixed, Logistics (expensive fulfillment)  vs Sentiments (people love pets)**

**Macro + Fundamental**

Chewy has been a covid winner due to stay-at-home increasing the rate of pet adoption. However, as a retailer, Chewy faces the same problems of logistical bottlenecks and increased labor costs due to their focus on quality distribution and fulfillment. Chewy is traded on its massive revenue and user growth, rather than a measure of its PE. Chewy’s problem here is twofold: first, despite the massive revenue, Chewy typically loses money per quarter. Second is the stagnating pet-adoption post-peak. Given its slow drain of sub 25 million per quarter and a cash balance of over 500m, I believe there is little risk of dilution. The key metrics to look at are: Gross margins, Customer numbers, and total lifetime-value (LTV)

**Technical**

PC ratio volume is at 1.57 and PC ratio OI is about 1.36 both of which are bearish. RSI is about 30, oversold. Implied movement about 14% or about $9. Short interest is 20% of float, with 3.4 days to cover. Given the magnitude of the last few months for Chewy, I believe a reasonable support lies at 40, or the March 2020 initial buying. Fib retracement at current levels are very difficult to pin and not considered. Given the high short interest, a gap up to 70 is likely on a positive beat and raise, with topside target being 80$. 

**Sentimental**

Everyone think its overvalued due to its sky high PE and lack of consistent profitability. While I agree its an optics issue, Amazon was not profitable for a long time though they were growing revenue very quickly. However, there is a high chance of stagnation, as lease for this quarter, on revenue growth due to the stagnation of pet adoptions. Recently, CHWY partnered up with Trupanion for pet insurance that will roll out spring 2022. This is a great move to improve revenue and monetize the user-base while not providing the insurance infrastructure themselves. SA quant rating is 2.62 out of 5. SA Author ratings slightly better at 3.5. Wall Street Ratings at 3.9, with price target average of about 93$, highest being 133 and lowest being 51. This also opens up for downgrades if performance is lackluster. Twitter is mostly negative, as is stockwits and wallstreetbets. (this means retail is predominately bearish)

**Given the high short interest, shorting calls/call spreads feel dangerous. Selling puts at the 40 level feels like the baseline play. IV is high enough to negate a lot of profitability for lesser movements, so net sell is logical. For those that want to play downside, I suggest a 12/17 put debit spread.**   


As best practice - if you're selling options for earnings, wait til 10 minutes before closing to do so to maximize IV and negate intra-day movements. If net buy, set levels and buy at levels.","CHEWY Earnings 12/9/2021 AH - High short interest, low expectations",53,1,"CHEWY Earnings 12/9/2021 AH - High short interest, low expectations There were some good DD posted, so I just filed in some gaps and provided another opinion.

But this isn't a post for that. To understand GME, and to wrap your head around why someone would want to invest in a failing company like this, I think you have to back in time to 2020 and follow the story.

The story goes a relatively quiet investor by the name of Ryan Cohen hires a fantastic lawyer to seek out a company that is trading below fair value, but has similar traits as his former investment Chewy and a lot of untapped potential. 

Now if you study this Cohen person then you'll know he's obsessed with customer satisfaction and know e-commerce strategy very well (unlike ICahn during the bb debacle).  

His investment firm adds approximately one investment to the portfolio. Shortly after the Q3 2020 ER, when the stock took a dump, My Cohen sends a letter out through his lawyer stressing the urgency of transformation... and increases his stake.

Next, we move into 2021 where the big sneeze happened, and about that time RC executes his semi-hostile take over of the board. From there RC starts to work on ousting dated executives, consolidating locations, raising capital, fixing balancesheets, creating distribution centers, refreshing talent, and so on... (if that doesn't show an implied strategy I don't know what does)

Is it perfect, no and Q3 2021 ER showed there's work to be done. But for those impatient and getting caught up in the MSM noise about no strategy, well I think you need to study RC a bit. He is not the kind of person who will talk a big game but would rather prove over time (quote coming straight from RC). Furthermore, he is all about strategic partnerships, and behind the scenes chess moves: [https://vimeo.com/374903101](https://vimeo.com/374903101)

Finally, RC felt a bittersweet void after selling Chewy and why he wants GME (Note: this is not the exact video where he states this... there's another where he's at the steps of NYSE talking about deep about the conflicting emotions but even in this one you can hear him briefly discuss the emotion):  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z31hgjEyVIc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z31hgjEyVIc)

RC is not the type of person who is going to do a lot of radical tactical maneuvers just to please the Wallstreet. He is methodical and will take his time. Patience is the game.

In summary: if you have money to invest, then pay more attention to the long term growth and strategy, and don't get caught up in the noise. If you back test many of the companies who have soared, you will notice they didn't overnight (prior to this crazy covid market we're in now). AMZN is great example (for better or worse). It stayed under $100 for most of 2000's and wasn't until their deep undercover innovations around cloud/aws, prime, etc... that sent the stock soaring. If you loaded the boat in the early 2000's and sat on shares you'd be very rich.

All this to say, I firmly believe GME is a long term investment, the squeeze is the icing on top, but the man at the helm is going to move very methodically and may take some time before his strategy is realized, but given the amount of pressure from shorting and manipulation I believe when he does finally go public this stock will fly (pre or post MOASS).

tl;dr GME is a long term investment, not a short term  play. Gamma squeezes are nice, and you can surely make a few bucks here and there trading. But if you want real wealth look to invest not trade.

What is Stock Sentiment?

When making investment decisions, sentiment gives a good overview of what stocks investors currently favor. Sentiment incorporates short-term technical analysis into its score and does not encompass any fundamental analysis such as profitability of the company. This means that earnings updates and other news can greatly impact overall sentiment. Changes in price are generally the best indicator of sentiment for a particular stock. At its core, a stock's trend indicates whether current market sentiment is bullish or bearish. Investors must be bullish if a stock is trending upward, and are bearish if a stock is moving down. InvestorsObserver's Sentiment Indicator factors in both price changes and variations in volume. An increase in volume usually means a current trend is stengthening, while a drop in volume tends to signal a reversal to the ongoing trend. Our system also uses the options market in order to receive additional signals on current sentiments. We take into account the ratio of calls and puts for a stock since options allow an investor to bet on future changes in price.

***Really?*** They didn't listen to the last earnings call.

* **HUBS's retention rate is at an all time high and still increasing**
* This is due to improvements in their product, not some one-time covid boost.
* HUBS put all their resources into improving existing features rather than building new ones for **an entire calendar year** a couple years ago, setting themselves up for better retention
   * This aligned perfectly for them with the pandemic; loads of new customers all with their new very high retention rate
* The other implication here that brick-and-mortar businesses that went online last year will now remove their digital presence is ridiculous

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;HubSpot’s growth decelerated for years prior to Covid

This is uninformed at best and misleading at worst.

* As stated previously, HUBS intentionally didn't release any new features in the year leading up to the pandemic to work on fixing bugs and improving customer happiness with existing features 
* Even so, this was a minor deceleration, **and they're talking about growth rate not growth**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Online reviews are blah, products are flawed, pricing is expensive 

Some quick googling shows this is **complete BS**. 

* Great customer reviews. 
* Pricing innovation with free CRM tiers.
* If you google ""I switched from salesforce to""... ""hubspot"" is the only auto-complete in the category (excel and outlook dont apply)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Competition is intense and growing rapidly. 

They then mention Salesforce. This is the **exact opposite** of what's happening. 

* HUBS is taking Salesforce customers not the other way around. 
* Salesforce does not capture the small business market like HUBS does. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;No wonder leadership is leaving &amp; dumping shares. Founder/CEO Brian Halligan handed reins to new CEO Yamini Rangan 

**Yet again, complete BS**. 

* Brian Halligan is still on as executive chair
* Probably wanted a break from CEO after his vehicle accident
* Leadership Isn't ""dumping shares"" they are executing normal timed sells which ANY company does.

&amp;#x200B;

**As you can see, this is a pretty laughable attempt at PR to profit from their bad position.** With the HUBS earnings call around the corner, and their string of great results, there is absolutely no reason why we wont get a big win quarter (and 2021 year) yet again.

* First bullish pt in play tomorrow
* Look for a 20 EMA test tomorrow

I would also like to say, I have tried to use as many pictures as I can for easy processing, and I have tried to organize this the best I can, but it's a lot of data, and I'm 4 hours into this at the time of writing this, so I am sorry if it's a little messy sometimes.

I am a numbers person.  I don't like fluff, and hype.  I like facts, and results.  I'm a software engineer, I like logic, it's my world lens, and I'm here to share with you why I think GME has to be one of the best plays in the market, if not the best play right now.

**Positions**

&amp;#x200B;

[All in.](https://preview.redd.it/zfqxsjxk2y981.png?width=749&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97d4817e012c24d935e8612eee850962a1fe21ff)

I have some cash sitting in my bank ready to get some more as I try to time the dip, which I believe will be sometime between now, and the middle of Febuary, and with this cash, I plan to get some June 17th 130c, and 150c, and some shares with whatever is left.  I'll now explain why I'm going for June 130c's, 150c's, and why I am still bullish on GME in the medium term (6 months)

**DD Start:**

I'll start with the crayons, since that's what most of you will scroll to first anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

[Don't put too much weight into this, it's just a visual representation for me to reference timestamps on the graph as I explain where we've been, and where we're going.](https://preview.redd.it/gp5asx0n2y981.png?width=974&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78a7ab496fb5a3e71842663da36df89a8cc1a4f5)

My TA is worthless without some explanation, so I have tried to label things as clearly as I can, to make this as easy to digest as possible, no fiber necessary ;)

The orange boxes represent the historical price ranges in the Jan -&gt; July window over the last 3 years.

The flags indicate the first trading day of the year, and July 17th, for each trading window

The yellow line is kind of like a candle within the orange box which I use to gauge my own expectations when charting.  This is a personal strategy, has little to do with the overall DD, but helps keep a frame of reference IMO.

Then, finally, the red boxes which are numbered.  These will be used as reference points to talk about GME, and their actions, and market sentiment for those trading windows.

My analysis of a company comes from actions that a company is taking to position themselves for the future, not where they are positioned today.  After all, you make money when you're early, not when you're late, and we all know hard hard it can be to time the market, especially as options traders, it's a core element of what we do, or try to do.

**#1, 2019 In Review:**

Ahhhhh  yes, 2019, covid isn't here yet, the world is running as it was designed to, and GME is a dying brick and motor company being led by an experienced brick and motor CEO, and executives, trying to survive in the gaming industry, arguably, one of the most technologically adoptive industries in the market.  The CEO decided to direct the company into primary collectables, and used hardware, and disks.  Essentially, a death sentence for the company.  It's clearly on a downtrend, since the retail sentiment, along with the wall street sentiment is that the company won't survive for 5 more years.

* **Game sales are primary digital** at this point.
* GameStop **has sizable debt** at this point.
* Their revenues, and sales, are clearly, and **rapidly declining**.
* The **leadership** constantly shouting 'multi-channel e-commerce business' as if that means anything anymore.
* GameStop looks like it's on the fast track to zero, as it should be based on it's **future market positioning**, and **leadership**.

At this point, GME has been shorted into oblivion, both by wallstreet, and retail, it's just not looking good for the company, anyone here could agree with that, except for maybe DFV, and other early GME bulls, but even they'd say it's risky at this point, and it might not work out.

This is just used as an example to show where the company was 2 years ago, which has significant influence when you're trying to gauge how fast a company can turn around, and make shifts in an industry.  We'd all be able to agree that 2019 GME, and 2021 GME are different beasts, although, with some of the same existing problems, which I'll touch on later.

&amp;#x200B;

**#2 (part 1), The Burrrrrry Chapter**

This is an interesting one, since there is a pretty significant spike in the share price, followed by a meltdown to previous levels.  There wasn't any news regarding GME actions at this time, however, there was an activist hedge fund who was invested into the company at the time, Scion Capital, which is managed by Michael Burrrrrrry.  From here, things get interesting, I'll try to use as many pictures as I can to keep your attention.

Lets start with the SEC filing for the purchase Scion Capital made of 3.4 million GME shares.

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/0001649339\/000090514820000491\/efc20-335\_sc13d.htm ](https://preview.redd.it/hujye2if3y981.png?width=339&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68ebfa57e8e8c18a0af688fd8eb5b8e48844c210)

Then, prior to the filing, Mr. Burrrrry wrote a letter to the GameStop Board of Directors, which I **STRONGLY RECOMMEND** reading, sorry if the screenshots are too small, CBA to enlarge the page, source is included in the caption.

**Part 1:**

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/0001649339\/000090514820000491\/efc20-335\_sc13d.htm ](https://preview.redd.it/46snbrop2y981.png?width=2546&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ada5cb36bdaafdc75c2804a92853c99f0d64b0e)

**Part 2:**

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/0001649339\/000090514820000491\/efc20-335\_sc13d.htm ](https://preview.redd.it/g0e9no8q2y981.png?width=2532&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e472774bf988930eeb43a7c43a512b337fd25284)

&amp;#x200B;

[Just goes to show the INSANE short conviction, which later detailed by the proof of naked shorts by the SEC is not shocking since the only way out is to admit to illegal activity for SHF, and market makers involved.](https://preview.redd.it/ltk4re5m3y981.png?width=697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33ec24a6a205a419a59cde870a39f666daa2e0c6)

As you can see by the dates I have highlighted above, Michael Burry suggested to GameStop that they are heavily, and unreasonably sold short, since they have more cash on-hand publicly than their company is even being valued at.  This is a huge red-flag for a term called '[death spiral financing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_spiral_financing)'.  Michael Burry caught it in the very early phases by pointing out that they had debt accruing, and enough money to pay it off, while also doing a share buyback, and expressed concern that the company leadership had chosen to not take that action yet.  He also suggested to combat the overwhelming short interest that was building on GME.  This is extremely evident looking back due to data given by the SEC GameStop investigation/report that was published (see image below), along with Michael Burrys own provided data in his letter.

This is a big part of what led to the **January 2021 sneeze**.

As you can see, the 13D filing Michael Burrrrry filed is dated 'April 2nd, 2019', which directly correlates to the graph, as the spike here starts on April 3rd, **the day after the letter was delivered to the GME leadership**, and brings the stock price from $2.67 at the low on April 9th, to the peak of $6.40 on April 14th.  This is the time-frame where Scion capital made it's GME purchase of 3.4 million shares.

&amp;#x200B;

**#2 (part 2) The Ryan Cohen Chapter (this happened between #2, and #3 on my graph)**

Quick backstory on RC before we move on:

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ryan\_Cohen ](https://preview.redd.it/tkpbuc4s2y981.png?width=2145&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c1929451cff13da12e1303068d3eb9044d061f7)

Long story short, he took a company from round 1 VC funding in 2013 @ 15 million, to selling the company in 2017 for $3.35 billion, which was the largest e-commerce acquisition of all time.  That's a 4 year timeline from nothing to billions.  Innovative, disruptive, and efficient.

Between #2, and #3 on my chart, RC made his initial purchases of GME shares, which he filed in his 13D filing of his investment company, RC Ventures LLC, which was a total of 5.8 million shares, pictured below.

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/fintel.io\/doc\/sec-gme-gamestop-rc-ventures-llc-sc-13d-2020-august-28-18502 \(scroll to bottom\)](https://preview.redd.it/w8eu9ddt2y981.png?width=1903&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5ba1f9e8845017ade3cf6de72cc361dedfb9e71)

RC made 6 purchases, the first being over 5% of the company, which required him to file a 13D, and the rest being adding to that position, which required a 13D/A, essentially adding to a position greater than 5% of the outstanding shares of a company, used for almost all hostile takeovers.  You will see the green boom boom candles between #2, and #3 directly correlate to the days that these filings are created.

&amp;#x200B;

[httpsL\/\/fintel.io\/if\/rc-ventures-llc](https://preview.redd.it/l79unusp3y981.png?width=1864&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c24aff60f6085ff245b32821faa75724ec3ef11)

RC wrote a letter to the GameStop Board of Directors as well, saying to follow a new direction of becoming a tech company, allowing digital trade-ins, and a customer first approach.  I **HIGHLY RECOMMEND** reading this, since it's from the single largest shareholder of GME since Jan 1st, 2021, a man who turned $15M into $3.35B in a mere 4 years.

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1326380\/000101359420000821\/rc13da3-111620.pdf Pay special attention to the #2 bullet point, it's important in my explanation for my #4 box.](https://preview.redd.it/qt6lf1mv2y981.png?width=883&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f2067cc07c9d7e9bc1b6d6992c6bf779e19a817)

&amp;#x200B;

**#3 The Sneeze, the Awakening, DFV, and You**

This is the part of the graph that I feel needs no explanation really, that is, if you were here a year ago.  We were jacked on Tesla, and GME.  DFV finally was popular after about a year of his bleeding calls posts, and was in the green, thanks to Michael Burry, Ryan Cohen, and his own understanding of where this company was going, and the relentless SI.

&amp;#x200B;

[The Roaring Kitty](https://preview.redd.it/0bef8zqq3y981.png?width=1283&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e26600e067e3e502dee663586ffca6c94dd58919)

We here, on WSB, love options plays, especially options plays that have a lot of research.  A lot of analytical background, and that were drawn up with crayons, and memes.

While #2 was happening, WSB was growing, and GME was one of the most talked about stocks, both in a positive, and negative lights here.  Lots of people got their stimulus checks, and also were on Reddit, and for some reason, those wonderful retards that WSB was a place for good investment advice, bless their souls, they didn't know better at the time, hell, some still don't.

WSB grew from 2 million users, to 10 million users in the time-span between #2, and #3.  If you were here for that, you know it was chaos, and you probably remember the talks of 'the end of the OG WSB'.  In a lot of ways, that was very accurate, and in other ways, it was less accurate, WSB has evolved, for sure, lots of meaningless DD flared posts, shills, and way more retards playing FD's than ever.  Just look at the TSLA posts this last week, and you'll see that there is still an embodiment of what WSB stands for.

I'm getting sentimental, so I'll leave it there, just know, I love you retards.

**Adding Up The Facts**

Michael Burry pointed out in his letter that there was an insane amount of SI, and that more shares were trading for GME at the time, than shares that should be possible to trade, IE, 'naked shorts'.  The SEC confirmed this for us earlier this year with their GameStop investigation:

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/files\/staff-report-equity-options-market-struction-conditions-early-2021.pdf ](https://preview.redd.it/20545ass3y981.png?width=569&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbdb4210c2853825f80d77c12441870af60de5df)

On December 31st, 2020, GME had more than 100% short interest confirmed by the SEC, AKA, naked shorts.  To clarify, this means that without a shadow of a doubt, not a \*\*NOT A SINGLE SHARE WAS AVAILABLE\*\* to be sold long on the day December 31st, 2020, in a fair, and free market.  The SEC also confirms in this investigation that the shorts didn't close during the January run-up, they diamond handed, and hoped for the best, a feeling many of us know all too well.

This now brings us to January 3rd, 2021, WSB is growing massively, most people just barely got their stimulus in the mail/direct deposited, and are ready to throw it into the wall street casino.  They do what the average retard would do, buy some shares, and OTM weeklies/monthlies based on DD that was posted by some internet stranger (this time it's me, what's up), and knowing that there are \*\*ZERO SHARES AVAILABLE FOR GME AS OF THE LAST FRIDAY\*\*,  this puts extreme pressure on brokers, since they can't locate the shares.  They can't internalize.  They are fucked, market makers are fucked, SHF are fucked, and the DTCC + NSCC are freaking out.  They internally agree to turn off the buy button across a series of clearing houses, which forces brokers to turn their buy buttons off.

RH got the wrist slap from this, but don't forget, Webull, Public, T212, and many others also turned the buy button off.  This is because they got direct orders from Apex Clearing that they cannot process buy orders.  This requires some of the small SHF to buy-back shares from us, WSB.  We gave them the biggest, dirtiest middle finger we could.  We essentially took down Melvin Capital, P72, Citron, and many others.

We were all fucked by the buy button being turned off, since the majority of us had calls, which expire worthless if not exercised, and not enough money to exercise.  Many made money, more lost money, SHF's got bailed out by Citadel, their market maker, and partner in crime, and supposedly, life was supposed to keep going as if nothing happened?

Fuck no, we diamond handed that shit, at least many of us did.  We had been talking on WSB about the possible squeeze for MONTHS.  We're not going out without a fight, we doubled the fuck down, tripled down, diamond handed, exercised OTM calls, and did everything we could to put as much pressure as we could on those that took everything from us in 2008, 1970, etc.  We finally had the ace, they were wrong, we won.

The NSCC, and DTCC waived all fees, and SHF, and Citadel created massive can kicked positions to deal with the volume that they didn't have on-hand.  They bent the rules, and tried to force us out.  Looking at the graph again, this is the best part.

**#3, and #4 We're Still Here, and The Shorts Are Still There:**

There's clearly apes here, GameStop sold 5m shares into the market to raise $1.7B  in cash, there's still practically no float (which we can prove without a doubt now, thanks to GameStop filing their latest quarterly report), and shorts still are in the play, naked, or not.  They stated that there was 5M shares registered with CS as of Oct. 30st, 2021.  This was over a quarter ago, and here is the data gathered by apes since then.

&amp;#x200B;

According to this graph, as of today, we are sitting at close to 8M shares completely locked away just from certain subs, which I'm not sure I'm allowed to mention here, so I won't, but lets be honest, you know what they are.

This, in addition to RC's 9,001,000 shares, insiders additional \~5,700,000 shares, Institutional ownership of \~10,000,000  shares, mutual funds owning \~8,000,000 shares, and ETFs holding \~6,700,000 shares, that leaves us with a mere \~28,282,228 shares remaining.

This data as you can see above, is likely about 3-5% higher for DRS'd shares than reality based on GameStops own report, which is detailed on the graph figure above.

**I hit the picture limit of reddit apparently, if you were wondering, it's 20**

So, I'll describe the rest the best I can, on the open see, there are 600,000-ish active users on a good month, and 280,000 on a bad month.  This gives them a **$13 billion dollar evaluation**.  GameStop is entering that space, rapidly, and efficiently, with premier partners, and their primary goal, with RC at the helm, is to delight customers.

GameStop, according to the letter RC wrote to the Board of Directors directly details that they have **55 million active subscriptions to their PowerUps program**.  If even **1%** of those users opt to try the new marketplace that GameStop is building, then GameStop will be a massive force to be reckoned with, short squeeze or no short squeeze.

**I think there is a short squeeze on the table still**, with GameStop hitting it's **lowest point in nearly a year today**, tons of shares locked away, and **11.4M WSB subscribers**, all it would take to repeat January 28th, 2021, is about **2 shares each, or $260**.  I remember when I saw people buying them by the hundreds, and many of us buying them at twice that for a single share.  I'm sure you love a home run, but I love to knock it out of the park with full bases, which is what we're looking at.  As of today, GameStop publicly reports **13.4%** short interest, and VW had a squeeze in 2008 which made it the **MOST VALUABLE COMPANY IN THE WORLD** with only **12.8%** short interest.

So, from here, all I have left to say is see you on the moon when the tendiman comes.

I'll now explain why I'm going for June 130c's, 150c's, and why I am still bullish on GME in the medium term (6 months)

**DD Start:**

I'll start with the crayons, since that's what most of you will scroll to first anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

[Don't put too much weight into this, it's just a visual representation for me to reference timestamps on the graph as I explain where we've been, and where we're going.](https://preview.redd.it/gp5asx0n2y981.png?width=974&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78a7ab496fb5a3e71842663da36df89a8cc1a4f5)

My TA is worthless without some explanation, so I have tried to label things as clearly as I can, to make this as easy to digest as possible, no fiber necessary ;)

The orange boxes represent the historical price ranges in the Jan -&gt; July window over the last 3 years.

The flags indicate the first trading day of the year, and July 17th, for each trading window

The yellow line is kind of like a candle within the orange box which I use to gauge my own expectations when charting.  This is a personal strategy, has little to do with the overall DD, but helps keep a frame of reference IMO.

Then, finally, the red boxes which are numbered.  These will be used as reference points to talk about GME, and their actions, and market sentiment for those trading windows.

My analysis of a company comes from actions that a company is taking to position themselves for the future, not where they are positioned today.  After all, you make money when you're early, not when you're late, and we all know hard hard it can be to time the market, especially as options traders, it's a core element of what we do, or try to do.

**#1, 2019 In Review:**

Ahhhhh  yes, 2019, covid isn't here yet, the world is running as it was designed to, and GME is a dying brick and motor company being led by an experienced brick and motor CEO, and executives, trying to survive in the gaming industry, arguably, one of the most technologically adoptive industries in the market.  The CEO decided to direct the company into primary collectables, and used hardware, and disks.  Essentially, a death sentence for the company.  It's clearly on a downtrend, since the retail sentiment, along with the wall street sentiment is that the company won't survive for 5 more years.

* **Game sales are primary digital** at this point.
* GameStop **has sizable debt** at this point.
* Their revenues, and sales, are clearly, and **rapidly declining**.
* The **leadership** constantly shouting 'multi-channel e-commerce business' as if that means anything anymore.
* GameStop looks like it's on the fast track to zero, as it should be based on it's **future market positioning**, and **leadership**.

At this point, GME has been shorted into oblivion, both by wallstreet, and retail, it's just not looking good for the company, anyone here could agree with that, except for maybe DFV, and other early GME bulls, but even they'd say it's risky at this point, and it might not work out.

This is just used as an example to show where the company was 2 years ago, which has significant influence when you're trying to gauge how fast a company can turn around, and make shifts in an industry.  We'd all be able to agree that 2019 GME, and 2021 GME are different beasts, although, with some of the same existing problems, which I'll touch on later.

&amp;#x200B;

**#2 (part 1), The Burrrrrry Chapter**

This is an interesting one, since there is a pretty significant spike in the share price, followed by a meltdown to previous levels.  There wasn't any news regarding GME actions at this time, however, there was an activist hedge fund who was invested into the company at the time, Scion Capital, which is managed by Michael Burrrrrrry.  From here, things get interesting, I'll try to use as many pictures as I can to keep your attention.

Lets start with the SEC filing for the purchase Scion Capital made of 3.4 million GME shares.

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/0001649339\/000090514820000491\/efc20-335\_sc13d.htm ](https://preview.redd.it/hujye2if3y981.png?width=339&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68ebfa57e8e8c18a0af688fd8eb5b8e48844c210)

Then, prior to the filing, Mr. Burrrrry wrote a letter to the GameStop Board of Directors, which I **STRONGLY RECOMMEND** reading, sorry if the screenshots are too small, CBA to enlarge the page, source is included in the caption.

**Part 1:**

&amp;#x200B;

[Just goes to show the INSANE short conviction, which later detailed by the proof of naked shorts by the SEC is not shocking since the only way out is to admit to illegal activity for SHF, and market makers involved.](https://preview.redd.it/ltk4re5m3y981.png?width=697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33ec24a6a205a419a59cde870a39f666daa2e0c6)

As you can see by the dates I have highlighted above, Michael Burry suggested to GameStop that they are heavily, and unreasonably sold short, since they have more cash on-hand publicly than their company is even being valued at.  This is a huge red-flag for a term called '[death spiral financing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_spiral_financing)'.  Michael Burry caught it in the very early phases by pointing out that they had debt accruing, and enough money to pay it off, while also doing a share buyback, and expressed concern that the company leadership had chosen to not take that action yet.  He also suggested to combat the overwhelming short interest that was building on GME.  This is extremely evident looking back due to data given by the SEC GameStop investigation/report that was published (see image below), along with Michael Burrys own provided data in his letter.

This is a big part of what led to the **January 2021 sneeze**.

As you can see, the 13D filing Michael Burrrrry filed is dated 'April 2nd, 2019', which directly correlates to the graph, as the spike here starts on April 3rd, **the day after the letter was delivered to the GME leadership**, and brings the stock price from $2.67 at the low on April 9th, to the peak of $6.40 on April 14th.  This is the time-frame where Scion capital made it's GME purchase of 3.4 million shares.

&amp;#x200B;

**#2 (part 2) The Ryan Cohen Chapter (this happened between #2, and #3 on my graph)**

Quick backstory on RC before we move on:

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ryan\_Cohen ](https://preview.redd.it/tkpbuc4s2y981.png?width=2145&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c1929451cff13da12e1303068d3eb9044d061f7)

Long story short, he took a company from round 1 VC funding in 2013 @ 15 million, to selling the company in 2017 for $3.35 billion, which was the largest e-commerce acquisition of all time.  That's a 4 year timeline from nothing to billions.  Innovative, disruptive, and efficient.

Between #2, and #3 on my chart, RC made his initial purchases of GME shares, which he filed in his 13D filing of his investment company, RC Ventures LLC, which was a total of 5.8 million shares, pictured below.

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/fintel.io\/doc\/sec-gme-gamestop-rc-ventures-llc-sc-13d-2020-august-28-18502 \(scroll to bottom\)](https://preview.redd.it/w8eu9ddt2y981.png?width=1903&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5ba1f9e8845017ade3cf6de72cc361dedfb9e71)

RC made 6 purchases, the first being over 5% of the company, which required him to file a 13D, and the rest being adding to that position, which required a 13D/A, essentially adding to a position greater than 5% of the outstanding shares of a company, used for almost all hostile takeovers.  You will see the green boom boom candles between #2, and #3 directly correlate to the days that these filings are created.

&amp;#x200B;

[httpsL\/\/fintel.io\/if\/rc-ventures-llc](https://preview.redd.it/l79unusp3y981.png?width=1864&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c24aff60f6085ff245b32821faa75724ec3ef11)

RC wrote a letter to the GameStop Board of Directors as well, saying to follow a new direction of becoming a tech company, allowing digital trade-ins, and a customer first approach.  I **HIGHLY RECOMMEND** reading this, since it's from the single largest shareholder of GME since Jan 1st, 2021, a man who turned $15M into $3.35B in a mere 4 years.

**#3 The Sneeze, the Awakening, DFV, and You**

This is the part of the graph that I feel needs no explanation really, that is, if you were here a year ago.  We were jacked on Tesla, and GME.  DFV finally was popular after about a year of his bleeding calls posts, and was in the green, thanks to Michael Burry, Ryan Cohen, and his own understanding of where this company was going, and the relentless SI.

&amp;#x200B;

[The Roaring Kitty](https://preview.redd.it/0bef8zqq3y981.png?width=1283&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e26600e067e3e502dee663586ffca6c94dd58919)

We here, on WSB, love options plays, especially options plays that have a lot of research.  A lot of analytical background, and that were drawn up with crayons, and memes.

While #2 was happening, WSB was growing, and GME was one of the most talked about stocks, both in a positive, and negative lights here.  Lots of people got their stimulus checks, and also were on Reddit, and for some reason, those wonderful retards that WSB was a place for good investment advice, bless their souls, they didn't know better at the time, hell, some still don't.

WSB grew from 2 million users, to 10 million users in the time-span between #2, and #3.  If you were here for that, you know it was chaos, and you probably remember the talks of 'the end of the OG WSB'.  In a lot of ways, that was very accurate, and in other ways, it was less accurate, WSB has evolved, for sure, lots of meaningless DD flared posts, shills, and way more retards playing FD's than ever.  Just look at the TSLA posts this last week, and you'll see that there is still an embodiment of what WSB stands for.

I'm getting sentimental, so I'll leave it there, just know, I love you retards.

**Adding Up The Facts**

Michael Burry pointed out in his letter that there was an insane amount of SI, and that more shares were trading for GME at the time, than shares that should be possible to trade, IE, 'naked shorts'.  The SEC confirmed this for us earlier this year with their GameStop investigation:

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/files\/staff-report-equity-options-market-struction-conditions-early-2021.pdf ](https://preview.redd.it/20545ass3y981.png?width=569&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbdb4210c2853825f80d77c12441870af60de5df)

On December 31st, 2020, GME had more than 100% short interest confirmed by the SEC, AKA, naked shorts.  To clarify, this means that without a shadow of a doubt, not a \*\*NOT A SINGLE SHARE WAS AVAILABLE\*\* to be sold long on the day December 31st, 2020, in a fair, and free market.  The SEC also confirms in this investigation that the shorts didn't close during the January run-up, they diamond handed, and hoped for the best, a feeling many of us know all too well.

This now brings us to January 3rd, 2021, WSB is growing massively, most people just barely got their stimulus in the mail/direct deposited, and are ready to throw it into the wall street casino.  They do what the average retard would do, buy some shares, and OTM weeklies/monthlies based on DD that was posted by some internet stranger (this time it's me, what's up), and knowing that there are \*\*ZERO SHARES AVAILABLE FOR GME AS OF THE LAST FRIDAY\*\*,  this puts extreme pressure on brokers, since they can't locate the shares.  They can't internalize.  They are fucked, market makers are fucked, SHF are fucked, and the DTCC + NSCC are freaking out.  They internally agree to turn off the buy button across a series of clearing houses, which forces brokers to turn their buy buttons off.

RH got the wrist slap from this, but don't forget, Webull, Public, T212, and many others also turned the buy button off.  This is because they got direct orders from Apex Clearing that they cannot process buy orders.  This requires some of the small SHF to buy-back shares from us, WSB.  We gave them the biggest, dirtiest middle finger we could.  We essentially took down Melvin Capital, P72, Citron, and many others.

We were all fucked by the buy button being turned off, since the majority of us had calls, which expire worthless if not exercised, and not enough money to exercise.  Many made money, more lost money, SHF's got bailed out by Citadel, their market maker, and partner in crime, and supposedly, life was supposed to keep going as if nothing happened?

Fuck no, we diamond handed that shit, at least many of us did.  We had been talking on WSB about the possible squeeze for MONTHS.  We're not going out without a fight, we doubled the fuck down, tripled down, diamond handed, exercised OTM calls, and did everything we could to put as much pressure as we could on those that took everything from us in 2008, 1970, etc.  We finally had the ace, they were wrong, we won.

The NSCC, and DTCC waived all fees, and SHF, and Citadel created massive can kicked positions to deal with the volume that they didn't have on-hand.  They bent the rules, and tried to force us out.  Looking at the graph again, this is the best part.

**#3, and #4 We're Still Here, and The Shorts Are Still There:**

There's clearly apes here, GameStop sold 5m shares into the market to raise $1.7B  in cash, there's still practically no float (which we can prove without a doubt now, thanks to GameStop filing their latest quarterly report), and shorts still are in the play, naked, or not.  They stated that there was 5M shares registered with CS as of Oct. 30st, 2021.  This was over a quarter ago, and here is the data gathered by apes since then.

&amp;#x200B;

According to this graph, as of today, we are sitting at close to 8M shares completely locked away just from certain subs, which I'm not sure I'm allowed to mention here, so I won't, but lets be honest, you know what they are.

This, in addition to RC's 9,001,000 shares, insiders additional \~5,700,000 shares, Institutional ownership of \~10,000,000  shares, mutual funds owning \~8,000,000 shares, and ETFs holding \~6,700,000 shares, that leaves us with a mere \~28,282,228 shares remaining.

This data as you can see above, is likely about 3-5% higher for DRS'd shares than reality based on GameStops own report, which is detailed on the graph figure above.

I'll keep this as mostly screenshots, I'm tired of writing, and you're probably tired of reading if you've made it this far.  Pay close attention to each one, since they are telling a story.

[With only 600k active members on a good month, this little dinky early JPEG trading company earned an evaluation of $13.3B with shitty name recognition, and a weak product that GameStop will replace completely in the next year or two.

**I hit the picture limit of reddit apparently, if you were wondering, it's 20**

So, I'll describe the rest the best I can, on the open see, there are 600,000-ish active users on a good month, and 280,000 on a bad month.  This gives them a **$13 billion dollar evaluation**.  GameStop is entering that space, rapidly, and efficiently, with premier partners, and their primary goal, with RC at the helm, is to delight customers.

GameStop, according to the letter RC wrote to the Board of Directors directly details that they have **55 million active subscriptions to their PowerUps program**.  If even **1%** of those users opt to try the new marketplace that GameStop is building, then GameStop will be a massive force to be reckoned with, short squeeze or no short squeeze.

**I think there is a short squeeze on the table still**, with GameStop hitting it's **lowest point in nearly a year today**, tons of shares locked away, and **11.4M WSB subscribers**, all it would take to repeat January 28th, 2021, is about **2 shares each, or $260**.  I remember when I saw people buying them by the hundreds, and many of us buying them at twice that for a single share.  I'm sure you love a home run, but I love to knock it out of the park with full bases, which is what we're looking at.  As of today, GameStop publicly reports **13.4%** short interest, and VW had a squeeze in 2008 which made it the **MOST VALUABLE COMPANY IN THE WORLD** with only **12.8%** short interest.

So, from here, all I have left to say is see you on the moon when the tendiman comes.

# Flashback - Christmas 2020

Let’s set the stage. Remember December 2020 ya’ll?

I sold 88,233 shares GME at $15.50 for some random dog toy in a box company. There were no apes yet, just Ryan Cohen buying more shares with hopes of a company turnaround. There were record COVID cases, vaccines were just approved, and there was even a British virus mutation on the way that turned out to be Delta!

# Arc of Blue Balls - Teasing little jack ($1.75M to $1.6M in 6 months)

## Chapter 1: The Squeeze

History was made in January 2021. Ryan Cohen joins the board on Jan 11. GME shoots +12% to $20 and then another +57% to $31. The media picks up the story and Elon Musk tweets “Gamestonk” and to the moon we go! Another +51% to $65. Then +92% to $150. And a deep fucking +135% to $347 before Vlad and the Hood ruined all the fun.

But we did it. History was made. The thesis was right. GME OGs are celebrating and drinking regal whiskey. Shorts got fucked and apes got born. WSB gains millions of normies. Financial world is never the same again.

And where am I? All-in CRSR with $1.7M and 1 share of GME I held on at a $20.81 cost basis. 

Lots of people have asked me about how I felt during this period, dealing with the FOMO or thinking about what could’ve been.

But the reality was: I was celebrating and dancing right alongside every single one of you GME winners. The thesis was right! This was an undervalued retail company that was way over-shorted.

Yes, I paper-handed in December and lost out on quick millions but that didn’t deter me to keep going. As a principle I don’t ever chase stocks so I let GME rocket however high it wanted to go and I just kept my eye on potential new plays. There’s always another play.

CRSR was bobbing up and down in a beautiful channel for most of Q1 until it wasn’t which made my Jan/Feb rather un-eventful merely breaking even.

## Chapter 2: RKT Up and Down

Huge short interest and a special dividend announcement in the 2/25 ER call seemed to awaken huge volume so I jumped on for the ride on 3/1 and it exploded 72% the next day gaining $1.2M overnight and bringing me to $2.9M! Almost a triple millionaire just like that.

Thinking these high volume squeeze plays usually go on for longer than a day, I held and it fell 33% immediately the next day losing me $1M. Let me tell you, **gaining a million and then losing it the very next day changes a man.**

As it rode the support line, I kept holding until the next 5/6 ER hoping that millennials are still in house-buying fever but that call gave conclusive evidence otherwise so I sold right after it dropped below support for a -19% loss.

## Chapter 3: Steel Gang

Next I decided to go all-in on CLF for the first time, an American steel company, thanks to one of the most well-researched theses I’ve ever read.

As you can see from my trading history above, CLF becomes my go-to safe haven for 2021 with 6 separate swings each netting decent % gains adding up to an amazing total $ gain.

But I’m a bit of a stock whore though as you’ll see, I love jumping around between different stocks trying to time the upswing. But CLF is like that dependable onii-chan you can return to after a good thrashing out in the harsh world and you need a good serving of humble pie.

# Arc of Erection - It’s squeezin’ season ($1.6M to $4.25M in 3 months)

Now it’s 6 months into the year and I was doing worse than the indexes! Little jack needed some more serious pumping. AMC had just christened a whole new cohort of apes, GME crossed $300 for the 3rd time, and it looked like squeezin’ season was upon us yet again.

## Chapter 4: Squeeze Trades

* **CLOV** \- 37% short interest and meme stocks were back in season so I left the safe embrace of steel to flirt with some squeezies. I finally stuck the multi-millionaire status going from $1.6M to $2.2M. Yes I sold a bit early and missed a giant squeeze on 6/8-6/9 which could’ve launched me to $5M+ but no point in having regrets, only learn from the mistakes
* **SOFI** \- Given this just deSPAC’d to the SOFI ticker, there was a tingle that said this ChamathSPAC might do something crazy too. I woke up and saw a 148% short interest while on the toilet and in a blur went all-in cause that was too good to be true. Turns out it was and my app had a data error (likely due to the ticker change) and I should’ve checked other sources and finished jacking off for that post-nut clarity before going all-in. Due to the 2-day good faith restriction in my 401k, had to wait 2 days until I could sell for a -8% loss
* **MVST** \- Adam Jonas gave this stock a $6 PT while at $8, the same guy who gave TSLA a $10 PT when it was at $200 pre-split. Because of lolz, I decided to inverse him and got my biggest % gain of 70% in only 5 trading days skyrocketing past $3M to $4.25M. And while I sold RKT too late and CLOV too early, this one I sold juuust right. That’s called learning folks

# Arc of Ascension - Rise to legend ($4.25M to $8M in 3 months)

[*Kenja-taimu*](https://www.jlect.com/entry/2891/kenjataimu-kenjataimu/) *(賢者タイム) - The post-orgasmic period when a man's thoughts are no longer impaired by his sexual drive; he is thus likened to a ""sage"" of clear mind. Literally ""sage time"".*

## Chapter 5: Luck or Skills?

* **PLTR** \- Jumped in right before 8/12 ER with a 0/5 ER track record on a hunch it’s been so disappointing in all aspects since Jan that any positivity in the ER should give it a nice bump. Got my first W thanks to strong commercial contracts growth and +13% in the bag.
* **SKLZ** \- Another big disappointment since Feb but seems to have bottomed out. Also because of Big. Buck. Hunter and the best [thesis](https://reddit.com/user/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/comments/pgpm33/do_i_have_to_post_every_day_yes_im_still_in_sklz/hbcxi1t/) I’ve ever written. Nothing majorly notable besides the thesis.
* **AMZN** \- Flight to safety after losing $400K thinking AMZN hadn’t moved much in 2021 but being a boomer was not much fun.
* **TMC** \- Major FOMO from missing out on Ironnet and OPAD’s deSPAC stock redemption gamma squeezes made me emotional. Mining special metals from the bottom of the ocean, sure why not? Well turns out it’s pretty [sketchy](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tmc-is-drowning-in-legal-woes-and-environmental-concerns-2021-10-25) so I’m glad I only threw $1M at it but still ate a -25% loss.

## Chapter 6: Plot Armor Fully Activated

* **CLF** \- It was so great to be back with steel gang after so many ins and outs just in time for 10/22 ER. I’ve never lost money with CLF and this time was no different. It was all up to LG to deliver and boy did he deliver with upgraded guidances and my 2nd ER win in a row. Getting on Twitch to hear the call live with steel gang is still one of my favorite memories. The [transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/22/cleveland-cliffs-clf-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/) is full of great quotes of LG demolishing analysts – “That's math lesson, not chemistry!” Officially a penta-millionaire with $5.7M.
* **TDOC** \- Time to go for the ER turkey with 3 Ws in a row. Went all-in on another decimated Aunt Cathy stock like PLTR with the hope that any positivity in the ER should give it a nice bump. On 10/27 after hours however, the stock drops -7% and little jack goes limp losing $400k. But the report looked… good? In a literal example of main character plot armor, the stock reverses in the morning and ends up +7% instead and little jack nuts to being a hexa-millionaire with $6.1M.

## Chapter 7: Big Fucking Climax

Thanks to /u/_beto619 for [pointing](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRaceTo10Million/comments/qhvelq/nabbed_the_6_with_new_ath_of_61m_im_a/hiym91u/) me in the direction of BiG Fucking Value, an undervalued sports retailer with a high short interest and earnings coming up. This play really had it all.

* Tossed in a million for the 11/2 ER thinking this could be like a CHGG or a CAR, literal coin flip. Turns out it was both, dropping 9% after hours but recovering by morning, just like TDOC, again with my plot armor at full power
* I decided to double down in the morning with another million and then tripled down and then said fuck it and went all in

I'm sure I’ll hit the elusive 8 digits again some time in life, it’s only 25% away

I look forward to seeing her again

# Fin - Post-coitus retirement

[Final 21 month all-time chart from $35K to $8M \(228X\)](https://preview.redd.it/abpejhi4np781.jpg?width=1284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da34294a73720fc8cb4479d7d728f610f751c546)

## What's Next?

* Just got back from a lovely 18-day trip in Europe enjoying the delicious delicacies of being FATFIRE such as paying 30 euros for tiramisu to be brought up by room service at midnight and currently relaxing with family on a beautiful snowy mountain.
* My plan is to DCA into SPY/QQQ over the next few months as I have no idea which way the market will go. While it feels like I did time the top on many individual stocks by retiring on 11/15, SPY/QQQ is right back to where it was on 11/15. I’m still worried about the effects of tapering, interest rate increases, and potential lowered guidances in next round of ERs but the market also seems to be just as strong as ever so DCA seems like the best strategy here.
   * Why am I being so conservative all of a sudden? Honestly I’m just tired from trying to perfectly time everything. It’s stressful keeping up with all the news and you feel bad if you mis-timed it. I want to focus my time and energy on other things so DCA allows me to re-enter the market with less stress
* In the new year I plan to quit my job and focus on 3 things: my health, my house, and a special project. I want to live a long healthy life to enjoy this newfound generational wealth, buy all the fancy toys and do all the fancy renovations to live in a beautiful home, and build a product based on everything I’ve learned these past 2 years about personal finance and community for you guys. And no it’s not a paid newsletter or chat group or anything stupid like that. Stay tuned!

# Final Message for My Little Jacks

I really believe I just got very lucky.

* The initial $35K in my 401k was an accident. I actually wanted to take my annual Jan bonus in cash to buy some toys but missed the cutoff date to change it in Dec so it defaulted to throwing my annual bonus in my 401k
* Started trading in Feb 2020 as COVID created the most bi-polar volatile market ever swinging between covid and recovery stocks quickly growing $35k to $900k in 4 months, something that is irreproducible
* Continued trading as meme stocks and short squeezes shook the financial world before they re-tuned their algorithms and shortened their potency
* Literally got lucky on 4 coin-flip-type ERs in a row

Live to fight another day. If it’s good enough to screenshot, it’s good enough to sell. Don’t chase. Use independent thinking. It’s just money. 

All these sayings… all these lessons… at the end of this journey I’m still not sure what to make of it all. Life is short. Enjoy it as best you can. Try to do good. And try to be lucky.

I’ll still be around, probably not posting much but maybe some comments here and there.

It’s been an absolute **life changing** time with you all.

# Flashback - Christmas 2020

Let’s set the stage. Remember December 2020 ya’ll?

I sold 88,233 shares GME at $15.50 for some random dog toy in a box company. There were no apes yet, just Ryan Cohen buying more shares with hopes of a company turnaround. There were record COVID cases, vaccines were just approved, and there was even a British virus mutation on the way that turned out to be Delta!

# Arc of Blue Balls - Teasing little jack ($1.75M to $1.6M in 6 months)

## Chapter 1: The Squeeze

History was made in January 2021. Ryan Cohen joins the board on Jan 11. GME shoots +12% to $20 and then another +57% to $31. The media picks up the story and Elon Musk tweets “Gamestonk” and to the moon we go! Another +51% to $65. Then +92% to $150. And a deep fucking +135% to $347 before Vlad and the Hood ruined all the fun.

But we did it. History was made. The thesis was right. GME OGs are celebrating and drinking regal whiskey. Shorts got fucked and apes got born. WSB gains millions of normies. Financial world is never the same again.

And where am I? All-in CRSR with $1.7M and 1 share of GME I held on at a $20.81 cost basis. 

Lots of people have asked me about how I felt during this period, dealing with the FOMO or thinking about what could’ve been.

But the reality was: I was celebrating and dancing right alongside every single one of you GME winners. The thesis was right! This was an undervalued retail company that was way over-shorted.

Yes, I paper-handed in December and lost out on quick millions but that didn’t deter me to keep going. As a principle I don’t ever chase stocks so I let GME rocket however high it wanted to go and I just kept my eye on potential new plays. There’s always another play.

CRSR was bobbing up and down in a beautiful channel for most of Q1 until it wasn’t which made my Jan/Feb rather un-eventful merely breaking even.

## Chapter 2: RKT Up and Down

Huge short interest and a special dividend announcement in the 2/25 ER call seemed to awaken huge volume so I jumped on for the ride on 3/1 and it exploded 72% the next day gaining $1.2M overnight and bringing me to $2.9M! Almost a triple millionaire just like that.

Thinking these high volume squeeze plays usually go on for longer than a day, I held and it fell 33% immediately the next day losing me $1M. Let me tell you, **gaining a million and then losing it the very next day changes a man.**

As it rode the support line, I kept holding until the next 5/6 ER hoping that millennials are still in house-buying fever but that call gave conclusive evidence otherwise so I sold right after it dropped below support for a -19% loss.

## Chapter 3: Steel Gang

Next I decided to go all-in on CLF for the first time, an American steel company, thanks to one of the most well-researched theses I’ve ever read.

As you can see from my trading history above, CLF becomes my go-to safe haven for 2021 with 6 separate swings each netting decent % gains adding up to an amazing total $ gain.

But I’m a bit of a stock whore though as you’ll see, I love jumping around between different stocks trying to time the upswing. But CLF is like that dependable onii-chan you can return to after a good thrashing out in the harsh world and you need a good serving of humble pie.

# Arc of Erection - It’s squeezin’ season ($1.6M to $4.25M in 3 months)

Now it’s 6 months into the year and I was doing worse than the indexes! Little jack needed some more serious pumping. AMC had just christened a whole new cohort of apes, GME crossed $300 for the 3rd time, and it looked like squeezin’ season was upon us yet again.

## Chapter 4: Squeeze Trades

* **CLOV** \- 37% short interest and meme stocks were back in season so I left the safe embrace of steel to flirt with some squeezies. I finally stuck the multi-millionaire status going from $1.6M to $2.2M. Yes I sold a bit early and missed a giant squeeze on 6/8-6/9 which could’ve launched me to $5M+ but no point in having regrets, only learn from the mistakes
* **SOFI** \- Given this just deSPAC’d to the SOFI ticker, there was a tingle that said this ChamathSPAC might do something crazy too. I woke up and saw a 148% short interest while on the toilet and in a blur went all-in cause that was too good to be true. Turns out it was and my app had a data error (likely due to the ticker change) and I should’ve checked other sources and finished jacking off for that post-nut clarity before going all-in. Due to the 2-day good faith restriction in my 401k, had to wait 2 days until I could sell for a -8% loss
* **MVST** \- Adam Jonas gave this stock a $6 PT while at $8, the same guy who gave TSLA a $10 PT when it was at $200 pre-split. Because of lolz, I decided to inverse him and got my biggest % gain of 70% in only 5 trading days skyrocketing past $3M to $4.25M. And while I sold RKT too late and CLOV too early, this one I sold juuust right. That’s called learning folks

# Arc of Ascension - Rise to legend ($4.25M to $8M in 3 months)

[*Kenja-taimu*](https://www.jlect.com/entry/2891/kenjataimu-kenjataimu/) *(賢者タイム) - The post-orgasmic period when a man's thoughts are no longer impaired by his sexual drive; he is thus likened to a ""sage"" of clear mind. Literally ""sage time"".*

## Chapter 5: Luck or Skills?

* **PLTR** \- Jumped in right before 8/12 ER with a 0/5 ER track record on a hunch it’s been so disappointing in all aspects since Jan that any positivity in the ER should give it a nice bump. Got my first W thanks to strong commercial contracts growth and +13% in the bag.
* **SKLZ** \- Another big disappointment since Feb but seems to have bottomed out. Also because of Big. Buck. Hunter and the best [thesis](https://reddit.com/user/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/comments/pgpm33/do_i_have_to_post_every_day_yes_im_still_in_sklz/hbcxi1t/) I’ve ever written. Nothing majorly notable besides the thesis.
* **AMZN** \- Flight to safety after losing $400K thinking AMZN hadn’t moved much in 2021 but being a boomer was not much fun.
* **TMC** \- Major FOMO from missing out on Ironnet and OPAD’s deSPAC stock redemption gamma squeezes made me emotional. Mining special metals from the bottom of the ocean, sure why not? Well turns out it’s pretty [sketchy](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tmc-is-drowning-in-legal-woes-and-environmental-concerns-2021-10-25) so I’m glad I only threw $1M at it but still ate a -25% loss.

## Chapter 6: Plot Armor Fully Activated

* **CLF** \- It was so great to be back with steel gang after so many ins and outs just in time for 10/22 ER. I’ve never lost money with CLF and this time was no different. It was all up to LG to deliver and boy did he deliver with upgraded guidances and my 2nd ER win in a row. Getting on Twitch to hear the call live with steel gang is still one of my favorite memories. The [transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/22/cleveland-cliffs-clf-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/) is full of great quotes of LG demolishing analysts – “That's math lesson, not chemistry!” Officially a penta-millionaire with $5.7M.
* **TDOC** \- Time to go for the ER turkey with 3 Ws in a row. Went all-in on another decimated Aunt Cathy stock like PLTR with the hope that any positivity in the ER should give it a nice bump. On 10/27 after hours however, the stock drops -7% and little jack goes limp losing $400k. But the report looked… good? In a literal example of main character plot armor, the stock reverses in the morning and ends up +7% instead and little jack nuts to being a hexa-millionaire with $6.1M.

## Chapter 7: Big Fucking Climax

Thanks to /u/_beto619 for [pointing](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRaceTo10Million/comments/qhvelq/nabbed_the_6_with_new_ath_of_61m_im_a/hiym91u/) me in the direction of BiG Fucking Value, an undervalued sports retailer with a high short interest and earnings coming up. This play really had it all.

* Tossed in a million for the 11/2 ER thinking this could be like a CHGG or a CAR, literal coin flip. Turns out it was both, dropping 9% after hours but recovering by morning, just like TDOC, again with my plot armor at full power
* I decided to double down in the morning with another million and then tripled down and then said fuck it and went all in
* Found out the GME OGs including /u/Uberkikz11, /u/Jeffamazon, /u/FatAspirations, /u/CPTHubbard were all on top of this play as well and it felt like a reunion
* Created a Twitter account just to react live on a Twitter Spaces with Rod Alzmann aka Uberkikz11. Someone managed to record the last 25 minutes of it [here](https://youtu.be/ZsgJ1629eio)
* Crossed $7M, then $8M, and even $9M and touched $10m for a literal 2 minutes and all I got was this [screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/eo8acvyoxtz71.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9b6f9cf64871010dc3354879e891f77da79ee9c)
* Decided in a moment of post-nut [epiphany](https://www.reddit.com/user/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/comments/quradf/fin_35k_to_8m_228x_in_21_months_officially/hkrtri3/), that I’ve achieved my original goal of escaping from wage slavery and $8M is enough and I’m officially retiring

I'm sure I’ll hit the elusive 8 digits again some time in life, it’s only 25% away

I look forward to seeing her again

# Final Message for My Little Jacks

I really believe I just got very lucky.

* The initial $35K in my 401k was an accident. I actually wanted to take my annual Jan bonus in cash to buy some toys but missed the cutoff date to change it in Dec so it defaulted to throwing my annual bonus in my 401k
* Started trading in Feb 2020 as COVID created the most bi-polar volatile market ever swinging between covid and recovery stocks quickly growing $35k to $900k in 4 months, something that is irreproducible
* Continued trading as meme stocks and short squeezes shook the financial world before they re-tuned their algorithms and shortened their potency
* Literally got lucky on 4 coin-flip-type ERs in a row

Live to fight another day. If it’s good enough to screenshot, it’s good enough to sell. Don’t chase. Use independent thinking. It’s just money. 

All these sayings… all these lessons… at the end of this journey I’m still not sure what to make of it all. Life is short. Enjoy it as best you can. Try to do good. And try to be lucky.

I’ll still be around, probably not posting much but maybe some comments here and there.

It’s been an absolute **life changing** time with you all.

Gather 'round again fellow retards and autists. SIR JACK A LOT is back with a sequel to last year’s [Magnum Dong Opus](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kjyzh7/a_sir_jack_a_lot_christmas_carol_my_magnum_dong/) on turning $35K to $1.75M (50X) in 2020 by going all-in on a single stock all-shares.

In this post I share my journey from $1.75M to $8M in 2021 and announce my official retirement from trading. Read on for receipts and an epic tale of blue balls to hard-on erection and a climactic finale.

My secret? Post-nut clarity.

# Flashback - Christmas 2020

Let’s set the stage. Remember December 2020 ya’ll?

I sold 88,233 shares GME at $15.50 for some random dog toy in a box company. There were no apes yet, just Ryan Cohen buying more shares with hopes of a company turnaround. There were record COVID cases, vaccines were just approved, and there was even a British virus mutation on the way that turned out to be Delta!

# Arc of Blue Balls - Teasing little jack ($1.75M to $1.6M in 6 months)

## Chapter 1: The Squeeze

History was made in January 2021. Ryan Cohen joins the board on Jan 11. GME shoots +12% to $20 and then another +57% to $31. The media picks up the story and Elon Musk tweets “Gamestonk” and to the moon we go! Another +51% to $65. Then +92% to $150. And a deep fucking +135% to $347 before Vlad and the Hood ruined all the fun.

But we did it. History was made. The thesis was right. GME OGs are celebrating and drinking regal whiskey. Shorts got fucked and apes got born. WSB gains millions of normies. Financial world is never the same again.

And where am I? All-in CRSR with $1.7M and 1 share of GME I held on at a $20.81 cost basis. 

Lots of people have asked me about how I felt during this period, dealing with the FOMO or thinking about what could’ve been.

But the reality was: I was celebrating and dancing right alongside every single one of you GME winners. The thesis was right! This was an undervalued retail company that was way over-shorted.

Yes, I paper-handed in December and lost out on quick millions but that didn’t deter me to keep going. As a principle I don’t ever chase stocks so I let GME rocket however high it wanted to go and I just kept my eye on potential new plays. There’s always another play.

CRSR was bobbing up and down in a beautiful channel for most of Q1 until it wasn’t which made my Jan/Feb rather un-eventful merely breaking even.

## Chapter 2: RKT Up and Down

Huge short interest and a special dividend announcement in the 2/25 ER call seemed to awaken huge volume so I jumped on for the ride on 3/1 and it exploded 72% the next day gaining $1.2M overnight and bringing me to $2.9M! Almost a triple millionaire just like that.

Thinking these high volume squeeze plays usually go on for longer than a day, I held and it fell 33% immediately the next day losing me $1M. Let me tell you, **gaining a million and then losing it the very next day changes a man.**

As it rode the support line, I kept holding until the next 5/6 ER hoping that millennials are still in house-buying fever but that call gave conclusive evidence otherwise so I sold right after it dropped below support for a -19% loss.

## Chapter 3: Steel Gang

Next I decided to go all-in on CLF for the first time, an American steel company, thanks to one of the most well-researched theses I’ve ever read.

As you can see from my trading history above, CLF becomes my go-to safe haven for 2021 with 6 separate swings each netting decent % gains adding up to an amazing total $ gain.

But I’m a bit of a stock whore though as you’ll see, I love jumping around between different stocks trying to time the upswing. But CLF is like that dependable onii-chan you can return to after a good thrashing out in the harsh world and you need a good serving of humble pie.

# Arc of Erection - It’s squeezin’ season ($1.6M to $4.25M in 3 months)

Now it’s 6 months into the year and I was doing worse than the indexes! Little jack needed some more serious pumping. AMC had just christened a whole new cohort of apes, GME crossed $300 for the 3rd time, and it looked like squeezin’ season was upon us yet again.

## Chapter 4: Squeeze Trades

* **CLOV** \- 37% short interest and meme stocks were back in season so I left the safe embrace of steel to flirt with some squeezies. I finally stuck the multi-millionaire status going from $1.6M to $2.2M. Yes I sold a bit early and missed a giant squeeze on 6/8-6/9 which could’ve launched me to $5M+ but no point in having regrets, only learn from the mistakes
* **SOFI** \- Given this just deSPAC’d to the SOFI ticker, there was a tingle that said this ChamathSPAC might do something crazy too. I woke up and saw a 148% short interest while on the toilet and in a blur went all-in cause that was too good to be true. Turns out it was and my app had a data error (likely due to the ticker change) and I should’ve checked other sources and finished jacking off for that post-nut clarity before going all-in. Due to the 2-day good faith restriction in my 401k, had to wait 2 days until I could sell for a -8% loss
* **MVST** \- Adam Jonas gave this stock a $6 PT while at $8, the same guy who gave TSLA a $10 PT when it was at $200 pre-split. Because of lolz, I decided to inverse him and got my biggest % gain of 70% in only 5 trading days skyrocketing past $3M to $4.25M. And while I sold RKT too late and CLOV too early, this one I sold juuust right. That’s called learning folks

# Arc of Ascension - Rise to legend ($4.25M to $8M in 3 months)

[*Kenja-taimu*](https://www.jlect.com/entry/2891/kenjataimu-kenjataimu/) *(賢者タイム) - The post-orgasmic period when a man's thoughts are no longer impaired by his sexual drive; he is thus likened to a ""sage"" of clear mind. Literally ""sage time"".*

## Chapter 5: Luck or Skills?

* **PLTR** \- Jumped in right before 8/12 ER with a 0/5 ER track record on a hunch it’s been so disappointing in all aspects since Jan that any positivity in the ER should give it a nice bump. Got my first W thanks to strong commercial contracts growth and +13% in the bag.
* **SKLZ** \- Another big disappointment since Feb but seems to have bottomed out. Also because of Big. Buck. Hunter and the best [thesis](https://reddit.com/user/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/comments/pgpm33/do_i_have_to_post_every_day_yes_im_still_in_sklz/hbcxi1t/) I’ve ever written. Nothing majorly notable besides the thesis.
* **AMZN** \- Flight to safety after losing $400K thinking AMZN hadn’t moved much in 2021 but being a boomer was not much fun.
* **TMC** \- Major FOMO from missing out on Ironnet and OPAD’s deSPAC stock redemption gamma squeezes made me emotional. Mining special metals from the bottom of the ocean, sure why not? Well turns out it’s pretty [sketchy](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tmc-is-drowning-in-legal-woes-and-environmental-concerns-2021-10-25) so I’m glad I only threw $1M at it but still ate a -25% loss.

## Chapter 6: Plot Armor Fully Activated

* **CLF** \- It was so great to be back with steel gang after so many ins and outs just in time for 10/22 ER. I’ve never lost money with CLF and this time was no different. It was all up to LG to deliver and boy did he deliver with upgraded guidances and my 2nd ER win in a row. Getting on Twitch to hear the call live with steel gang is still one of my favorite memories. The [transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/22/cleveland-cliffs-clf-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/) is full of great quotes of LG demolishing analysts – “That's math lesson, not chemistry!” Officially a penta-millionaire with $5.7M.
* **TDOC** \- Time to go for the ER turkey with 3 Ws in a row. Went all-in on another decimated Aunt Cathy stock like PLTR with the hope that any positivity in the ER should give it a nice bump. On 10/27 after hours however, the stock drops -7% and little jack goes limp losing $400k. But the report looked… good? In a literal example of main character plot armor, the stock reverses in the morning and ends up +7% instead and little jack nuts to being a hexa-millionaire with $6.1M.

## Chapter 7: Big Fucking Climax

Thanks to /u/_beto619 for [pointing](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRaceTo10Million/comments/qhvelq/nabbed_the_6_with_new_ath_of_61m_im_a/hiym91u/) me in the direction of BiG Fucking Value, an undervalued sports retailer with a high short interest and earnings coming up. This play really had it all.

* Tossed in a million for the 11/2 ER thinking this could be like a CHGG or a CAR, literal coin flip. Turns out it was both, dropping 9% after hours but recovering by morning, just like TDOC, again with my plot armor at full power
* I decided to double down in the morning with another million and then tripled down and then said fuck it and went all in
* Found out the GME OGs including /u/Uberkikz11, /u/Jeffamazon, /u/FatAspirations, /u/CPTHubbard were all on top of this play as well and it felt like a reunion
* Created a Twitter account just to react live on a Twitter Spaces with Rod Alzmann aka Uberkikz11. Someone managed to record the last 25 minutes of it [here](https://youtu.be/ZsgJ1629eio)
* Crossed $7M, then $8M, and even $9M and touched $10m for a literal 2 minutes and all I got was this [screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/eo8acvyoxtz71.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9b6f9cf64871010dc3354879e891f77da79ee9c)
* Decided in a moment of post-nut [epiphany](https://www.reddit.com/user/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/comments/quradf/fin_35k_to_8m_228x_in_21_months_officially/hkrtri3/), that I’ve achieved my original goal of escaping from wage slavery and $8M is enough and I’m officially retiring

I'm sure I’ll hit the elusive 8 digits again some time in life, it’s only 25% away

I look forward to seeing her again

## What's Next?

* Just got back from a lovely 18-day trip in Europe enjoying the delicious delicacies of being FATFIRE such as paying 30 euros for tiramisu to be brought up by room service at midnight and currently relaxing with family on a beautiful snowy mountain.
* My plan is to DCA into SPY/QQQ over the next few months as I have no idea which way the market will go. While it feels like I did time the top on many individual stocks by retiring on 11/15, SPY/QQQ is right back to where it was on 11/15. I’m still worried about the effects of tapering, interest rate increases, and potential lowered guidances in next round of ERs but the market also seems to be just as strong as ever so DCA seems like the best strategy here.
   * Why am I being so conservative all of a sudden? Honestly I’m just tired from trying to perfectly time everything. It’s stressful keeping up with all the news and you feel bad if you mis-timed it. I want to focus my time and energy on other things so DCA allows me to re-enter the market with less stress
* In the new year I plan to quit my job and focus on 3 things: my health, my house, and a special project. I want to live a long healthy life to enjoy this newfound generational wealth, buy all the fancy toys and do all the fancy renovations to live in a beautiful home, and build a product based on everything I’ve learned these past 2 years about personal finance and community for you guys. And no it’s not a paid newsletter or chat group or anything stupid like that. Stay tuned!

# Final Message for My Little Jacks

I really believe I just got very lucky.

* The initial $35K in my 401k was an accident. I actually wanted to take my annual Jan bonus in cash to buy some toys but missed the cutoff date to change it in Dec so it defaulted to throwing my annual bonus in my 401k
* Started trading in Feb 2020 as COVID created the most bi-polar volatile market ever swinging between covid and recovery stocks quickly growing $35k to $900k in 4 months, something that is irreproducible
* Continued trading as meme stocks and short squeezes shook the financial world before they re-tuned their algorithms and shortened their potency
* Literally got lucky on 4 coin-flip-type ERs in a row

Live to fight another day. If it’s good enough to screenshot, it’s good enough to sell. Don’t chase. Use independent thinking. It’s just money. 

All these sayings… all these lessons… at the end of this journey I’m still not sure what to make of it all. Life is short. Enjoy it as best you can. Try to do good. And try to be lucky.

I’ll still be around, probably not posting much but maybe some comments here and there.

It’s been an absolute **life changing** time with you all.

# Flashback - Christmas 2020

Let’s set the stage. Remember December 2020 ya’ll?

I sold 88,233 shares GME at $15.50 for some random dog toy in a box company. There were no apes yet, just Ryan Cohen buying more shares with hopes of a company turnaround. There were record COVID cases, vaccines were just approved, and there was even a British virus mutation on the way that turned out to be Delta!

# Arc of Blue Balls - Teasing little jack ($1.75M to $1.6M in 6 months)

## Chapter 1: The Squeeze

History was made in January 2021. Ryan Cohen joins the board on Jan 11. GME shoots +12% to $20 and then another +57% to $31. The media picks up the story and Elon Musk tweets “Gamestonk” and to the moon we go! Another +51% to $65. Then +92% to $150. And a deep fucking +135% to $347 before Vlad and the Hood ruined all the fun.

But we did it. History was made. The thesis was right. GME OGs are celebrating and drinking regal whiskey. Shorts got fucked and apes got born. WSB gains millions of normies. Financial world is never the same again.

And where am I? All-in CRSR with $1.7M and 1 share of GME I held on at a $20.81 cost basis. 

Lots of people have asked me about how I felt during this period, dealing with the FOMO or thinking about what could’ve been.

But the reality was: I was celebrating and dancing right alongside every single one of you GME winners. The thesis was right! This was an undervalued retail company that was way over-shorted.

Yes, I paper-handed in December and lost out on quick millions but that didn’t deter me to keep going. As a principle I don’t ever chase stocks so I let GME rocket however high it wanted to go and I just kept my eye on potential new plays. There’s always another play.

CRSR was bobbing up and down in a beautiful channel for most of Q1 until it wasn’t which made my Jan/Feb rather un-eventful merely breaking even.

## Chapter 2: RKT Up and Down

Huge short interest and a special dividend announcement in the 2/25 ER call seemed to awaken huge volume so I jumped on for the ride on 3/1 and it exploded 72% the next day gaining $1.2M overnight and bringing me to $2.9M! Almost a triple millionaire just like that.

Thinking these high volume squeeze plays usually go on for longer than a day, I held and it fell 33% immediately the next day losing me $1M. Let me tell you, **gaining a million and then losing it the very next day changes a man.**

As it rode the support line, I kept holding until the next 5/6 ER hoping that millennials are still in house-buying fever but that call gave conclusive evidence otherwise so I sold right after it dropped below support for a -19% loss.

## Chapter 3: Steel Gang

Next I decided to go all-in on CLF for the first time, an American steel company, thanks to one of the most well-researched theses I’ve ever read.

As you can see from my trading history above, CLF becomes my go-to safe haven for 2021 with 6 separate swings each netting decent % gains adding up to an amazing total $ gain.

But I’m a bit of a stock whore though as you’ll see, I love jumping around between different stocks trying to time the upswing. But CLF is like that dependable onii-chan you can return to after a good thrashing out in the harsh world and you need a good serving of humble pie.

# Arc of Erection - It’s squeezin’ season ($1.6M to $4.25M in 3 months)

Now it’s 6 months into the year and I was doing worse than the indexes! Little jack needed some more serious pumping. AMC had just christened a whole new cohort of apes, GME crossed $300 for the 3rd time, and it looked like squeezin’ season was upon us yet again.

## Chapter 4: Squeeze Trades

* **CLOV** \- 37% short interest and meme stocks were back in season so I left the safe embrace of steel to flirt with some squeezies. I finally stuck the multi-millionaire status going from $1.6M to $2.2M. Yes I sold a bit early and missed a giant squeeze on 6/8-6/9 which could’ve launched me to $5M+ but no point in having regrets, only learn from the mistakes
* **SOFI** \- Given this just deSPAC’d to the SOFI ticker, there was a tingle that said this ChamathSPAC might do something crazy too. I woke up and saw a 148% short interest while on the toilet and in a blur went all-in cause that was too good to be true. Turns out it was and my app had a data error (likely due to the ticker change) and I should’ve checked other sources and finished jacking off for that post-nut clarity before going all-in. Due to the 2-day good faith restriction in my 401k, had to wait 2 days until I could sell for a -8% loss
* **MVST** \- Adam Jonas gave this stock a $6 PT while at $8, the same guy who gave TSLA a $10 PT when it was at $200 pre-split. Because of lolz, I decided to inverse him and got my biggest % gain of 70% in only 5 trading days skyrocketing past $3M to $4.25M. And while I sold RKT too late and CLOV too early, this one I sold juuust right. That’s called learning folks

Nothing majorly notable besides the thesis.
* **AMZN** \- Flight to safety after losing $400K thinking AMZN hadn’t moved much in 2021 but being a boomer was not much fun.
* **TMC** \- Major FOMO from missing out on Ironnet and OPAD’s deSPAC stock redemption gamma squeezes made me emotional. Mining special metals from the bottom of the ocean, sure why not? Well turns out it’s pretty [sketchy](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tmc-is-drowning-in-legal-woes-and-environmental-concerns-2021-10-25) so I’m glad I only threw $1M at it but still ate a -25% loss.

## Chapter 6: Plot Armor Fully Activated

* **CLF** \- It was so great to be back with steel gang after so many ins and outs just in time for 10/22 ER. I’ve never lost money with CLF and this time was no different. It was all up to LG to deliver and boy did he deliver with upgraded guidances and my 2nd ER win in a row. Getting on Twitch to hear the call live with steel gang is still one of my favorite memories.

* **TDOC** \- Time to go for the ER turkey with 3 Ws in a row. Went all-in on another decimated Aunt Cathy stock like PLTR with the hope that any positivity in the ER should give it a nice bump. On 10/27 after hours however, the stock drops -7% and little jack goes limp losing $400k. But the report looked… good? In a literal example of main character plot armor, the stock reverses in the morning and ends up +7% instead and little jack nuts to being a hexa-millionaire with $6.1M.

I'm sure I’ll hit the elusive 8 digits again some time in life, it’s only 25% away

I look forward to seeing her again

* Started trading in Feb 2020 as COVID created the most bi-polar volatile market ever swinging between covid and recovery stocks quickly growing $35k to $900k in 4 months, something that is irreproducible
* Continued trading as meme stocks and short squeezes shook the financial world before they re-tuned their algorithms and shortened their potency
* Literally got lucky on 4 coin-flip-type ERs in a row

Live to fight another day. If it’s good enough to screenshot, it’s good enough to sell. Don’t chase. Use independent thinking. It’s just money. 

All these sayings… all these lessons… at the end of this journey I’m still not sure what to make of it all. Life is short. Enjoy it as best you can. Try to do good. And try to be lucky.

I’ll still be around, probably not posting much but maybe some comments here and there.

It’s been an absolute **life changing** time with you all.

Gather 'round again fellow retards and autists. SIR JACK A LOT is back with a sequel to last year’s [Magnum Dong Opus](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kjyzh7/a_sir_jack_a_lot_christmas_carol_my_magnum_dong/) on turning $35K to $1.75M (50X) in 2020 by going all-in on a single stock all-shares.

In this post I share my journey from $1.75M to $8M in 2021 and announce my official retirement from trading. Read on for receipts and an epic tale of blue balls to hard-on erection and a climactic finale.

My secret? Post-nut clarity.

# Flashback - Christmas 2020

Let’s set the stage. Remember December 2020 ya’ll?

I sold 88,233 shares GME at $15.50 for some random dog toy in a box company. There were no apes yet, just Ryan Cohen buying more shares with hopes of a company turnaround. There were record COVID cases, vaccines were just approved, and there was even a British virus mutation on the way that turned out to be Delta!

# Arc of Blue Balls - Teasing little jack ($1.75M to $1.6M in 6 months)

## Chapter 1: The Squeeze

History was made in January 2021. Ryan Cohen joins the board on Jan 11. GME shoots +12% to $20 and then another +57% to $31. The media picks up the story and Elon Musk tweets “Gamestonk” and to the moon we go! Another +51% to $65. Then +92% to $150. And a deep fucking +135% to $347 before Vlad and the Hood ruined all the fun.

But we did it. History was made. The thesis was right. GME OGs are celebrating and drinking regal whiskey. Shorts got fucked and apes got born. WSB gains millions of normies. Financial world is never the same again.

And where am I? All-in CRSR with $1.7M and 1 share of GME I held on at a $20.81 cost basis. 

Lots of people have asked me about how I felt during this period, dealing with the FOMO or thinking about what could’ve been.

But the reality was: I was celebrating and dancing right alongside every single one of you GME winners. The thesis was right! This was an undervalued retail company that was way over-shorted.

Yes, I paper-handed in December and lost out on quick millions but that didn’t deter me to keep going. As a principle I don’t ever chase stocks so I let GME rocket however high it wanted to go and I just kept my eye on potential new plays. There’s always another play.

CRSR was bobbing up and down in a beautiful channel for most of Q1 until it wasn’t which made my Jan/Feb rather un-eventful merely breaking even.

## Chapter 2: RKT Up and Down

Huge short interest and a special dividend announcement in the 2/25 ER call seemed to awaken huge volume so I jumped on for the ride on 3/1 and it exploded 72% the next day gaining $1.2M overnight and bringing me to $2.9M! Almost a triple millionaire just like that.

Thinking these high volume squeeze plays usually go on for longer than a day, I held and it fell 33% immediately the next day losing me $1M. Let me tell you, **gaining a million and then losing it the very next day changes a man.**

As it rode the support line, I kept holding until the next 5/6 ER hoping that millennials are still in house-buying fever but that call gave conclusive evidence otherwise so I sold right after it dropped below support for a -19% loss.

## Chapter 3: Steel Gang

Next I decided to go all-in on CLF for the first time, an American steel company, thanks to one of the most well-researched theses I’ve ever read.

As you can see from my trading history above, CLF becomes my go-to safe haven for 2021 with 6 separate swings each netting decent % gains adding up to an amazing total $ gain.

But I’m a bit of a stock whore though as you’ll see, I love jumping around between different stocks trying to time the upswing. But CLF is like that dependable onii-chan you can return to after a good thrashing out in the harsh world and you need a good serving of humble pie.

# Arc of Erection - It’s squeezin’ season ($1.6M to $4.25M in 3 months)

Now it’s 6 months into the year and I was doing worse than the indexes! Little jack needed some more serious pumping. AMC had just christened a whole new cohort of apes, GME crossed $300 for the 3rd time, and it looked like squeezin’ season was upon us yet again.

## Chapter 4: Squeeze Trades

* **CLOV** \- 37% short interest and meme stocks were back in season so I left the safe embrace of steel to flirt with some squeezies. I finally stuck the multi-millionaire status going from $1.6M to $2.2M. Yes I sold a bit early and missed a giant squeeze on 6/8-6/9 which could’ve launched me to $5M+ but no point in having regrets, only learn from the mistakes
* **SOFI** \- Given this just deSPAC’d from IPOE to SOFI, there was a tingle that said this ChamathSPAC might do something crazy too. I woke up and saw a 148% short interest while on the toilet and in a blur went all-in cause that was too good to be true. Turns out it was and my app had a data error (likely due to the ticker change) and I should’ve checked other sources and finished jacking off for that post-nut clarity before going all-in. Due to the 2-day good faith restriction in my 401k, had to wait 2 days until I could sell for a -8% loss
* **MVST** \- Adam Jonas gave this stock a $6 PT while at $8, the same guy who gave TSLA a $10 PT when it was at $200 pre-split. Because of lolz, I decided to inverse him and got my biggest % gain of 70% in only 5 trading days skyrocketing past $3M to $4.25M. And while I sold RKT too late and CLOV too early, this one I sold juuust right. That’s called learning folks

# Arc of Ascension - Rise to legend ($4.25M to $8M in 3 months)

## Chapter 5: Luck or Skills?

* **PLTR** \- Jumped in right before 8/12 ER with a 0/5 ER track record on a hunch it’s been so disappointing in all aspects since Jan that any positivity in the ER should give it a nice bump. Got my first W thanks to strong commercial contracts growth and +13% in the bag.
* **SKLZ** \- Another big disappointment since Feb but seems to have bottomed out. Also because of Big. Buck. Hunter and the best [thesis](https://reddit.com/user/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/comments/pgpm33/do_i_have_to_post_every_day_yes_im_still_in_sklz/hbcxi1t/) I’ve ever written. Nothing majorly notable besides the thesis.
* **AMZN** \- Flight to safety after losing $400K thinking AMZN hadn’t moved much in 2021 but being a boomer was not much fun.
* **TMC** \- Major FOMO from missing out on IRNT and OPAD’s deSPAC stock redemption gamma squeezes made me emotional. Mining special metals from the bottom of the ocean, sure why not? Well turns out it’s pretty [sketchy](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tmc-is-drowning-in-legal-woes-and-environmental-concerns-2021-10-25) so I’m glad I only threw $1M at it but still ate a -25% loss.

## Chapter 6: Plot Armor Fully Activated

* **CLF** \- It was so great to be back with steel gang after so many ins and outs just in time for 10/22 ER. I’ve never lost money with CLF and this time was no different. It was all up to LG to deliver and boy did he deliver with upgraded guidances and my 2nd ER win in a row. Getting on Twitch to hear the call live with steel gang is still one of my favorite memories. The [transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/22/cleveland-cliffs-clf-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/) is full of great quotes of LG demolishing analysts – “That's math lesson, not chemistry!” Officially a penta-millionaire with $5.7M.
* **TDOC** \- Time to go for the ER turkey with 3 Ws in a row. Went all-in on another decimated Aunt Cathy stock like PLTR with the hope that any positivity in the ER should give it a nice bump. On 10/27 after hours however, the stock drops -7% and little jack goes limp losing $400k. But the report looked… good? In a literal example of main character plot armor, the stock reverses in the morning and ends up +7% instead and little jack nuts to being a hexa-millionaire with $6.1M.

## Chapter 7: Big Fucking Climax

Thanks to /u/_beto619 for [pointing](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRaceTo10Million/comments/qhvelq/nabbed_the_6_with_new_ath_of_61m_im_a/hiym91u/) me in the direction of BGFV, an undervalued sports retailer with a high short interest and earnings coming up. This play really had it all.

* Tossed in a million for the 11/2 ER thinking this could be like a CHGG or a CAR, literal coin flip. Turns out it was both, dropping 9% after hours but recovering by morning, just like TDOC, again with my plot armor at full power
* I decided to double down in the morning with another million and then tripled down and then said fuck it and went all in
* Found out the GME OGs including /u/Uberkikz11, /u/Jeffamazon, /u/FatAspirations, /u/CPTHubbard were all on top of this play as well and it felt like a reunion
* Created a Twitter account just to react live to BGFV on a Twitter Spaces with Rod Alzmann aka Uberkikz11. Someone managed to record the last 25 minutes of it [here](https://youtu.be/ZsgJ1629eio)
* Crossed $7M, then $8M, and even $9M and touched $10m for a literal 2 minutes and all I got was this [screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/eo8acvyoxtz71.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9b6f9cf64871010dc3354879e891f77da79ee9c)
* Decided in a moment of post-nut [epiphany](https://www.reddit.com/user/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/comments/quradf/fin_35k_to_8m_228x_in_21_months_officially/hkrtri3/), that I’ve achieved my original goal of escaping from wage slavery and $8M is enough and I’m officially retiring

I'm sure I’ll hit the elusive 8 digits again some time in life, it’s only 25% away

I look forward to seeing her again

# What's Next?

* Just got back from a lovely 18-day trip in Europe enjoying the delicious delicacies of being FATFIRE such as paying 30 euros for tiramisu to be brought up by room service at midnight and currently relaxing with family on a beautiful snowy mountain.
* My plan is to DCA into SPY/QQQ over the next few months as I have no idea which way the market will go. While it feels like I did time the top on many individual stocks by retiring on 11/15, SPY/QQQ is right back to where it was on 11/15. I’m still worried about the effects of tapering, interest rate increases, and potential lowered guidances in next round of ERs but the market also seems to be just as strong as ever so DCA seems like the best strategy here.
   * Why am I being so conservative all of a sudden? Honestly I’m just tired from trying to perfectly time everything. It’s stressful keeping up with all the news and you feel bad if you mis-timed it. I want to focus my time and energy on other things so DCA allows me to re-enter the market with less stress
* In the new year I plan to quit my job and focus on 3 things: my health, my house, and a special project. I want to live a long healthy life to enjoy this newfound generational wealth, buy all the fancy toys and do all the fancy renovations to live in a beautiful home, and build a product based on everything I’ve learned these past 2 years about personal finance and community for you guys. And no it’s not a paid newsletter or chat group or anything stupid like that. Stay tuned!

# Final Message for My Little Jacks

I really believe I just got very lucky.

* The initial $35K in my 401k was an accident. I actually wanted to take my annual Jan bonus in cash to buy some toys but missed the cutoff date to change it in Dec so it defaulted to throwing my annual bonus in my 401k
* Started trading in Feb 2020 as COVID created the most bi-polar volatile market ever swinging between covid and recovery stocks quickly growing $35k to $900k in 4 months, something that is irreproducible
* Continued trading as meme stocks and short squeezes shook the financial world before they re-tuned their algorithms and shortened their potency
* Literally got lucky on 4 coin-flip-type ERs in a row

Live to fight another day. If it’s good enough to screenshot, it’s good enough to sell. Don’t chase. Use independent thinking. It’s just money. 

All these sayings… all these lessons… at the end of this journey I’m still not sure what to make of it all. Life is short. Enjoy it as best you can. Try to do good. And try to be lucky.

I’ll still be around, probably not posting much but maybe some comments here and there.

It’s been an absolute **life changing** time with you all.

I'm sure I’ll hit the elusive 8 digits again some time in life, it’s only 25% away

I look forward to seeing her again

# Fin - Post-coitus retirement

[Final 21 month all-time chart from $35K to $8M \(228X\)](https://preview.redd.it/ctbvgdnbjp781.jpg?width=1284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d703d847cfc517491888483db23a7dad58618b3)

# What's Next?

* Just got back from a lovely 18-day trip in Europe enjoying the delicious delicacies of being FATFIRE such as paying 30 euros for tiramisu to be brought up by room service at midnight and currently relaxing with family on a beautiful snowy mountain.
* My plan is to DCA into SPY/QQQ over the next few months as I have no idea which way the market will go. While it feels like I did time the top on many individual stocks by retiring on 11/15, SPY/QQQ is right back to where it was on 11/15. I’m still worried about the effects of tapering, interest rate increases, and potential lowered guidances in next round of ERs but the market also seems to be just as strong as ever so DCA seems like the best strategy here.
   * Why am I being so conservative all of a sudden? Honestly I’m just tired from trying to perfectly time everything. It’s stressful keeping up with all the news and you feel bad if you mis-timed it. I want to focus my time and energy on other things so DCA allows me to re-enter the market with less stress
* In the new year I plan to quit my job and focus on 3 things: my health, my house, and a special project. I want to live a long healthy life to enjoy this newfound generational wealth, buy all the fancy toys and do all the fancy renovations to live in a beautiful home, and build a product based on everything I’ve learned these past 2 years about personal finance and community for you guys. And no it’s not a paid newsletter or chat group or anything stupid like that. Stay tuned!

## Shoutouts

* Lots of redditors who kept me thoroughly entertained over the year - /u/dong_opus, /u/CreepingFog, /u/platypus55, /u/alifeofataraxia, /u/lavenderviking, /u/raptors-2020, /u/Green_Lantern_4vr and many more
* GME OGs are the real deal, love you guys - /u/Uberkikz11, /u/Jeffamazon, /u/FatAspirations, /u/CPTHubbard 
* What’s a good race without some rivals? Along the way I met some fellow wage slaves all yolo-ing their way to 8 digits in their own ways that I’m proud to call my rivals in the greatest reality show of our times - /u/irishdud1, /u/401kdaytrade, /u/caddude42069, /u/Noah_Deez_Nutz \- ya’ll are goats in your own special ways. Really special ways.

## Trade Setup

* Ever single trade was done on my iPhone 7 Plus with the TD Ameritrade app. Usually on my Toto toilet. I use Webull desktop client and TradingView website for watching charts and technical analysis during the day on a second monitor separate from my work setup
   * I’ve since upgraded to the iPhone 13 Pro Max
* My 157 stock watch list in case people find it interesting, I’m constantly scanning these to watch trends and if anything interesting catches my eye: AMPL, AAWW, ADBE, AFRM, ASTS, ARKF, AMC, ARKG, ARKK, AMZN, AAL, AI, ABNB, ASAN, AMD, AAPL, BBBY, BGFV, BKKT, BX, BAC, BMBL, BB, BUZZ, BARK, BA, BYND, BABA, CHGG, CAR, CLNE, CLF, CCL, CAKE, CVNA, CRM, CRSP, CHWY, COST, CRSR, CLOV, COIN, DWAC, DNUT, DAL, DKNG, DOCU, DDOG, DASH, DBX, DIS, ENPH, FCEL, FVRR, F, FUBO, FB, FXI, FSLY, GTLB, GS, GOOG, GME, GLD, HLTH, HOOD, HD, HEAR, IPOF, ICLN, JD, KOSS, LC, LMT, LMND, LOW, LOGI, LCID, LUV, LULU, LYFT, MRNA, MTTR, MS, MVST, MP, MTCH, MGM, MVIS, MT, MSFT, NNDM, NCLH, NUE, NKE, NIO, NET, NVDA, NFLX, OPEN, OKTA, PFE, PSFE, PRPL, PINS, POSH, PD, PLBY, PLUG, PLTR, PTON, PYPL, QS, RIVN, RTX, RIDE, RBLX, RDFN, RKT, RCL, SDC, SOFI, SLV, SPCE, SKLZ, SFT, STLD, SBUX, SHOP, SNAP, SQ, TOST, TGT, TTD, TTCF, TWTR, TNDM, TDOC, TWLO, TSLA, UPST, UWMC, UAL, UBER, U, VIAC, VALE, VRM, V, WOOF, WISH, WKHS, W, X, ZIM, Z, ZM

# Final Message for My Little Jacks

I really believe I just got very lucky.

* The initial $35K in my 401k was an accident. I actually wanted to take my annual Jan bonus in cash to buy some toys but missed the cutoff date to change it in Dec so it defaulted to throwing my annual bonus in my 401k
* Started trading in Feb 2020 as COVID created the most bi-polar volatile market ever swinging between covid and recovery stocks quickly growing $35k to $900k in 4 months, something that is irreproducible
* Continued trading as meme stocks and short squeezes shook the financial world before they re-tuned their algorithms and shortened their potency
* Literally got lucky on 4 coin-flip-type ERs in a row

Live to fight another day. If it’s good enough to screenshot, it’s good enough to sell. Don’t chase. Use independent thinking. It’s just money. 

All these sayings… all these lessons… at the end of this journey I’m still not sure what to make of it all. Life is short. Enjoy it as best you can. Try to do good. And try to be lucky.

I’ll still be around, probably not posting much but maybe some comments here and there.

It’s been an absolute **life changing** time with you all.

# Flashback - Christmas 2020

Let’s set the stage. Remember December 2020 ya’ll?

I sold 88,233 shares GME at $15.50 for some random dog toy in a box company. There were no apes yet, just Ryan Cohen buying more shares with hopes of a company turnaround. There were record COVID cases, vaccines were just approved, and there was even a British virus mutation on the way that turned out to be Delta!

# Arc of Blue Balls - Teasing little jack ($1.75M to $1.6M in 6 months)

**Chapter 1: The Squeeze**

History was made in January 2021. Ryan Cohen joins the board on Jan 11. GME shoots +12% to $20 and then another +57% to $31. The media picks up the story and Elon Musk tweets “Gamestonk” and to the moon we go! Another +51% to $65. Then +92% to $150. And a deep fucking +135% to $347 before Vlad and the Hood ruined all the fun.

But we did it. History was made. The thesis was right. GME OGs are celebrating and drinking regal whiskey. Shorts got fucked and apes got born. WSB gains millions of normies. Financial world is never the same again.

And where am I? All-in CRSR with $1.7M and 1 share of GME I held on at a $20.81 cost basis. 

Lots of people have asked me about how I felt during this period, dealing with the FOMO or thinking about what could’ve been.

But the reality was: I was celebrating and dancing right alongside every single one of you GME winners. The thesis was right! This was an undervalued retail company that was way over-shorted.

Yes, I paper-handed in December and lost out on quick millions but that didn’t deter me to keep going. As a principle I don’t ever chase stocks so I let GME rocket however high it wanted to go and I just kept my eye on potential new plays. There’s always another play.

CRSR was bobbing up and down in a beautiful channel for most of Q1 until it wasn’t which made my Jan/Feb rather un-eventful merely breaking even.

**Chapter 2: RKT Up and Down**

Huge short interest and a special dividend announcement in the 2/25 ER call seemed to awaken huge volume so I jumped on for the ride on 3/1 and it exploded 72% the next day gaining $1.2M overnight and bringing me to $2.9M! Almost a triple millionaire just like that.

Thinking these high volume squeeze plays usually go on for longer than a day, I held and it fell 33% immediately the next day losing me $1M. Let me tell you, **gaining a million and then losing it the very next day changes a man.**

As it rode the support line, I kept holding until the next 5/6 ER hoping that millennials are still in house-buying fever but that call gave conclusive evidence otherwise so I sold right after it dropped below support for a -19% loss.

**Chapter 3: Steel Gang**

Next I decided to go all-in on CLF for the first time, an American steel company, thanks to one of the most well-researched theses I’ve ever read.

As you can see from my trading history above, CLF becomes my go-to safe haven for 2021 with 6 separate swings each netting decent % gains adding up to an amazing total $ gain.

But I’m a bit of a stock whore though as you’ll see, I love jumping around between different stocks trying to time the upswing. But CLF is like that dependable onii-chan you can return to after a good thrashing out in the harsh world and you need a good serving of humble pie.

# Arc of Erection - It’s squeezin’ season ($1.6M to $4.25M in 3 months)

Now it’s 6 months into the year and I was doing worse than the indexes! Little jack needed some more serious pumping. AMC had just christened a whole new cohort of apes, GME crossed $300 for the 3rd time, and it looked like squeezin’ season was upon us yet again.

**Chapter 4: Squeeze Trades**

* **CLOV** \- 37% short interest and meme stocks were back in season so I left the safe embrace of steel to flirt with some squeezies. I finally stuck the multi-millionaire status going from $1.6M to $2.2M. Yes I sold a bit early and missed a giant squeeze on 6/8-6/9 which could’ve launched me to $5M+ but no point in having regrets, only learn from the mistakes
* **SOFI** \- Given this just deSPAC’d from IPOE to SOFI, there was a tingle that said this ChamathSPAC might do something crazy too. I woke up and saw a 148% short interest while on the toilet and in a blur went all-in cause that was too good to be true. Turns out it was and my app had a data error (likely due to the ticker change) and I should’ve checked other sources and finished jacking off for that post-nut clarity before going all-in. Due to the 2-day good faith restriction in my 401k, had to wait 2 days until I could sell for a -8% loss
* **MVST** \- Adam Jonas gave this stock a $6 PT while at $8, the same guy who gave TSLA a $10 PT when it was at $200 pre-split. Because of lolz, I decided to inverse him and got my biggest % gain of 70% in only 5 trading days skyrocketing past $3M to $4.25M. And while I sold RKT too late and CLOV too early, this one I sold juuust right. That’s called learning folks

# Arc of Ascension - Rise to legend ($4.25M to $8M in 3 months)

[*Kenja-taimu*](https://www.jlect.com/entry/2891/kenjataimu-kenjataimu/) *(賢者タイム) - The post-orgasmic period when a man's thoughts are no longer impaired by his sexual drive; he is thus likened to a ""sage"" of clear mind. Literally ""sage time"".*

**Chapter 5: Luck or Skills?**

* **PLTR** \- Jumped in right before 8/12 ER with a 0/5 ER track record on a hunch it’s been so disappointing in all aspects since Jan that any positivity in the ER should give it a nice bump. Got my first W thanks to strong commercial contracts growth and +13% in the bag.
* **SKLZ** \- Another big disappointment since Feb but seems to have bottomed out. Also because of Big. Buck. Hunter and the best [thesis](https://reddit.com/user/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/comments/pgpm33/do_i_have_to_post_every_day_yes_im_still_in_sklz/hbcxi1t/) I’ve ever written. Nothing majorly notable besides the thesis.
* **AMZN** \- Flight to safety after losing $400K thinking AMZN hadn’t moved much in 2021 but being a boomer was not much fun.
* **TMC** \- Major FOMO from missing out on IRNT and OPAD’s deSPAC stock redemption gamma squeezes made me emotional. Mining special metals from the bottom of the ocean, sure why not? Well turns out it’s pretty [sketchy](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tmc-is-drowning-in-legal-woes-and-environmental-concerns-2021-10-25) so I’m glad I only threw $1M at it but still ate a -25% loss.

**Chapter 6: Plot Armor Fully Activated**

* **CLF** \- It was so great to be back with steel gang after so many ins and outs just in time for 10/22 ER. I’ve never lost money with CLF and this time was no different. It was all up to LG to deliver and boy did he deliver with upgraded guidances and my 2nd ER win in a row. Getting on Twitch to hear the call live with steel gang is still one of my favorite memories. The [transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/22/cleveland-cliffs-clf-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/) is full of great quotes of LG demolishing analysts – “That's math lesson, not chemistry!” Officially a penta-millionaire with $5.7M.
* **TDOC** \- Time to go for the ER turkey with 3 Ws in a row. Went all-in on another decimated Aunt Cathy stock like PLTR with the hope that any positivity in the ER should give it a nice bump. On 10/27 after hours however, the stock drops -7% and little jack goes limp losing $400k. But the report looked… good? In a literal example of main character plot armor, the stock reverses in the morning and ends up +7% instead and little jack nuts to being a hexa-millionaire with $6.1M.

**Chapter 7: Big Fucking Climax**

Thanks to /u/_beto619 for [pointing](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRaceTo10Million/comments/qhvelq/nabbed_the_6_with_new_ath_of_61m_im_a/hiym91u/) me in the direction of BGFV, an undervalued sports retailer with a high short interest and earnings coming up. This play really had it all.

* Tossed in a million for the 11/2 ER thinking this could be like a CHGG or a CAR, literal coin flip. Turns out it was both, dropping 9% after hours but recovering by morning, just like TDOC, again with my plot armor at full power
* I decided to double down in the morning with another million and then tripled down and then said fuck it and went all in
* Found out the GME OGs including /u/Uberkikz11, /u/Jeffamazon, /u/FatAspirations, /u/CPTHubbard were all on top of this play as well and it felt like a reunion
* Created a Twitter account just to react live to BGFV on a Twitter Spaces with Rod Alzmann aka Uberkikz11. Someone managed to record the last 25 minutes of it [here](https://youtu.be/ZsgJ1629eio)
* Crossed $7M, then $8M, and even $9M and touched $10m for a literal 2 minutes and all I got was this [screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/eo8acvyoxtz71.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9b6f9cf64871010dc3354879e891f77da79ee9c)
* Decided in a moment of post-nut [epiphany](https://www.reddit.com/user/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/comments/quradf/fin_35k_to_8m_228x_in_21_months_officially/hkrtri3/), that I’ve achieved my original goal of escaping from wage slavery and $8M is enough and I’m officially retiring

I'm sure I’ll hit the elusive 8 digits again some time in life, it’s only 25% away

I look forward to seeing her again

# Fin - Post-coitus retirement

[Final 21 month all-time chart from $35K to $8M \(228X\)](https://preview.redd.it/f6wnrvywgp781.jpg?width=1284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b92844a5d9e430059d1f27e0d7b07c0a02ff5d79)

**What's Next?**

* Just got back from a lovely 18-day trip in Europe enjoying the delicious delicacies of being FATFIRE such as paying 30 euros for tiramisu to be brought up by room service at midnight and currently relaxing with family on a beautiful snowy mountain.
* My plan is to DCA into SPY/QQQ over the next few months as I have no idea which way the market will go. While it feels like I did time the top on many individual stocks by retiring on 11/15, SPY/QQQ is right back to where it was on 11/15. I’m still worried about the effects of tapering, interest rate increases, and potential lowered guidances in next round of ERs but the market also seems to be just as strong as ever so DCA seems like the best strategy here.
   * Why am I being so conservative all of a sudden? Honestly I’m just tired from trying to perfectly time everything. It’s stressful keeping up with all the news and you feel bad if you mis-timed it. I want to focus my time and energy on other things so DCA allows me to re-enter the market with less stress
* In the new year I plan to quit my job and focus on 3 things: my health, my house, and a special project. I want to live a long healthy life to enjoy this newfound generational wealth, buy all the fancy toys and do all the fancy renovations to live in a beautiful home, and build a product based on everything I’ve learned these past 2 years about personal finance and community for you guys. And no it’s not a paid newsletter or chat group or anything stupid like that. Stay tuned!

**Shoutouts**

* Lots of redditors who kept me thoroughly entertained over the year - /u/dong_opus, /u/CreepingFog, /u/platypus55, /u/alifeofataraxia, /u/lavenderviking, /u/raptors-2020, /u/Green_Lantern_4vr and many more
* GME OGs are the real deal, love you guys - /u/Uberkikz11, /u/Jeffamazon, /u/FatAspirations, /u/CPTHubbard 
* What’s a good race without some rivals? Along the way I met some fellow wage slaves all yolo-ing their way to 8 digits in their own ways that I’m proud to call my rivals in the greatest reality show of our times - /u/irishdud1, /u/401kdaytrade, /u/caddude42069, /u/Noah_Deez_Nutz \- ya’ll are goats in your own special ways. Really special ways.
* /u/IKnowTheCodings for un-knowingly challenging my ego with his [gains post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/grap5c/4_years_of_gains/) 2 years ago leading me to start posting and addicted to the titillation of internet points

**Trade Setup**

* Ever single trade was done on my iPhone 7 Plus with the TD Ameritrade app. Usually on my Toto toilet. I use Webull desktop client and TradingView website for watching charts and technical analysis during the day on a second monitor separate from my work setup
   * I’ve since upgraded to the iPhone 13 Pro Max
* My 157 stock watch list in case people find it interesting, I’m constantly scanning these to watch trends and if anything interesting catches my eye: AMPL, AAWW, ADBE, AFRM, ASTS, ARKF, AMC, ARKG, ARKK, AMZN, AAL, AI, ABNB, ASAN, AMD, AAPL, BBBY, BGFV, BKKT, BX, BAC, BMBL, BB, BUZZ, BARK, BA, BYND, BABA, CHGG, CAR, CLNE, CLF, CCL, CAKE, CVNA, CRM, CRSP, CHWY, COST, CRSR, CLOV, COIN, DWAC, DNUT, DAL, DKNG, DOCU, DDOG, DASH, DBX, DIS, ENPH, FCEL, FVRR, F, FUBO, FB, FXI, FSLY, GTLB, GS, GOOG, GME, GLD, HLTH, HOOD, HD, HEAR, IPOF, ICLN, JD, KOSS, LC, LMT, LMND, LOW, LOGI, LCID, LUV, LULU, LYFT, MRNA, MTTR, MS, MVST, MP, MTCH, MGM, MVIS, MT, MSFT, NNDM, NCLH, NUE, NKE, NIO, NET, NVDA, NFLX, OPEN, OKTA, PFE, PSFE, PRPL, PINS, POSH, PD, PLBY, PLUG, PLTR, PTON, PYPL, QS, RIVN, RTX, RIDE, RBLX, RDFN, RKT, RCL, SDC, SOFI, SLV, SPCE, SKLZ, SFT, STLD, SBUX, SHOP, SNAP, SQ, TOST, TGT, TTD, TTCF, TWTR, TNDM, TDOC, TWLO, TSLA, UPST, UWMC, UAL, UBER, U, VIAC, VALE, VRM, V, WOOF, WISH, WKHS, W, X, ZIM, Z, ZM

## Final Message for My Little Jacks

I really believe I just got very lucky.

* The initial $35K in my 401k was an accident. I actually wanted to take my annual Jan bonus in cash to buy some toys but missed the cutoff date to change it in Dec so it defaulted to throwing my annual bonus in my 401k
* Started trading in Feb 2020 as COVID created the most bi-polar volatile market ever swinging between covid and recovery stocks quickly growing $35k to $900k in 4 months, something that is irreproducible
* Continued trading as meme stocks and short squeezes shook the financial world before they re-tuned their algorithms and shortened their potency
* Literally got lucky on 4 coin-flip-type ERs in a row

Live to fight another day. If it’s good enough to screenshot, it’s good enough to sell. Don’t chase. Use independent thinking. It’s just money. 

All these sayings… all these lessons… at the end of this journey I’m still not sure what to make of it all. Life is short. Enjoy it as best you can. Try to do good. And try to be lucky.

I’ll still be around, probably not posting much but maybe some comments here and there.

It’s been an absolute **life changing** time with you all.

* **SOFI** \- Given this just deSPAC’d from IPOE to SOFI, there was a tingle that said this ChamathSPAC might do something crazy too. I woke up and saw a 148% short interest while on the toilet and in a blur went all-in cause that was too good to be true. Turns out it was and my app had a data error (likely due to the ticker change) and I should’ve checked other sources and finished jacking off for that post-nut clarity before going all-in. Due to the 2-day good faith restriction in my 401k, had to wait 2 days until I could sell for a -8% loss
* **MVST** \- Adam Jonas gave this stock a $6 PT while at $8, the same guy who gave TSLA a $10 PT when it was at $200 pre-split. Because of lolz, I decided to inverse him and got my biggest % gain of 70% in only 5 trading days skyrocketing past $3M to $4.25M. And while I sold RKT too late and CLOV too early, this one I sold juuust right. That’s called learning folks

# Arc of Ascension - Rise to legend ($4.25M to $8M in 3 months)

[*Kenja-taimu*](https://www.jlect.com/entry/2891/kenjataimu-kenjataimu/) *(賢者タイム) - The post-orgasmic period when a man's thoughts are no longer impaired by his sexual drive; he is thus likened to a ""sage"" of clear mind. Literally ""sage time"".*

**Chapter 5: Luck or Skills?**

* **PLTR** \- Jumped in right before 8/12 ER with a 0/5 ER track record on a hunch it’s been so disappointing in all aspects since Jan that any positivity in the ER should give it a nice bump. Got my first W thanks to strong commercial contracts growth and +13% in the bag.
* **SKLZ** \- Another big disappointment since Feb but seems to have bottomed out. Also because of Big. Buck. Hunter and the best [thesis](https://reddit.com/user/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/comments/pgpm33/do_i_have_to_post_every_day_yes_im_still_in_sklz/hbcxi1t/) I’ve ever written. Nothing majorly notable besides the thesis.
* **AMZN** \- Flight to safety after losing $400K thinking AMZN hadn’t moved much in 2021 but being a boomer was not much fun.
* **TMC** \- Major FOMO from missing out on IRNT and OPAD’s deSPAC stock redemption gamma squeezes made me emotional. Mining special metals from the bottom of the ocean, sure why not? Well turns out it’s pretty [sketchy](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tmc-is-drowning-in-legal-woes-and-environmental-concerns-2021-10-25) so I’m glad I only threw $1M at it but still ate a -25% loss.

**Chapter 6: Plot Armor Fully Activated**

* **CLF** \- It was so great to be back with steel gang after so many ins and outs just in time for 10/22 ER. I’ve never lost money with CLF and this time was no different. It was all up to LG to deliver and boy did he deliver with upgraded guidances and my 2nd ER win in a row. Getting on Twitch to hear the call live with steel gang is still one of my favorite memories. The [transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/22/cleveland-cliffs-clf-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/) is full of great quotes of LG demolishing analysts – “That's math lesson, not chemistry!” Officially a penta-millionaire with $5.7M.
* **TDOC** \- Time to go for the ER turkey with 3 Ws in a row. Went all-in on another decimated Aunt Cathy stock like PLTR with the hope that any positivity in the ER should give it a nice bump. On 10/27 after hours however, the stock drops -7% and little jack goes limp losing $400k. But the report looked… good? In a literal example of main character plot armor, the stock reverses in the morning and ends up +7% instead and little jack nuts to being a hexa-millionaire with $6.1M.

**Chapter 7: Big Fucking Climax**

Thanks to /u/_beto619 for [pointing](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRaceTo10Million/comments/qhvelq/nabbed_the_6_with_new_ath_of_61m_im_a/hiym91u/) me in the direction of BGFV, an undervalued sports retailer with a high short interest and earnings coming up. This play really had it all.

* Tossed in a million for the 11/2 ER thinking this could be like a CHGG or a CAR, literal coin flip. Turns out it was both, dropping 9% after hours but recovering by morning, just like TDOC, again with my plot armor at full power
* I decided to double down in the morning with another million and then tripled down and then said fuck it and went all in
* Found out the GME OGs including /u/Uberkikz11, /u/Jeffamazon, /u/FatAspirations, /u/CPTHubbard were all on top of this play as well and it felt like a reunion
* Created a Twitter account just to react live to BGFV on a Twitter Spaces with Rod Alzmann aka Uberkikz11. Someone managed to record the last 25 minutes of it [here](https://youtu.be/ZsgJ1629eio)
* Crossed $7M, then $8M, and even $9M and touched $10m for a literal 2 minutes and all I got was this [screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/eo8acvyoxtz71.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9b6f9cf64871010dc3354879e891f77da79ee9c)
* Decided in a moment of post-nut [epiphany](https://www.reddit.com/user/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/comments/quradf/fin_35k_to_8m_228x_in_21_months_officially/hkrtri3/), that I’ve achieved my original goal of escaping from wage slavery and $8M is enough and I’m officially retiring

I'm sure I’ll hit the elusive 8 digits again some time in life, it’s only 25% away

I look forward to seeing her again

# Fin - Post-coitus retirement

[Final 21 month all-time chart from $35K to $8M \(228X\)](https://preview.redd.it/f6wnrvywgp781.jpg?width=1284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b92844a5d9e430059d1f27e0d7b07c0a02ff5d79)

**What's Next?**

* Just got back from a lovely 18-day trip in Europe enjoying the delicious delicacies of being FATFIRE such as paying 30 euros for tiramisu to be brought up by room service at midnight and currently relaxing with family on a beautiful snowy mountain.
* My plan is to DCA into SPY/QQQ over the next few months as I have no idea which way the market will go. While it feels like I did time the top on many individual stocks by retiring on 11/15, SPY/QQQ is right back to where it was on 11/15. I’m still worried about the effects of tapering, interest rate increases, and potential lowered guidances in next round of ERs but the market also seems to be just as strong as ever so DCA seems like the best strategy here.
   * Why am I being so conservative all of a sudden? Honestly I’m just tired from trying to perfectly time everything. It’s stressful keeping up with all the news and you feel bad if you mis-timed it. I want to focus my time and energy on other things so DCA allows me to re-enter the market with less stress
* In the new year I plan to quit my job and focus on 3 things: my health, my house, and a special project. I want to live a long healthy life to enjoy this newfound generational wealth, buy all the fancy toys and do all the fancy renovations to live in a beautiful home, and build a product based on everything I’ve learned these past 2 years about personal finance and community for you guys. And no it’s not a paid newsletter or chat group or anything stupid like that. Stay tuned!

**Shoutouts**

* Lots of redditors who kept me thoroughly entertained over the year - /u/dong_opus, /u/CreepingFog, /u/platypus55, /u/alifeofataraxia, /u/lavenderviking, /u/raptors-2020, /u/Green_Lantern_4vr and many more
* GME OGs are the real deal, love you guys - /u/Uberkikz11, /u/Jeffamazon, /u/FatAspirations, /u/CPTHubbard 
* What’s a good race without some rivals? Along the way I met some fellow wage slaves all yolo-ing their way to 8 digits in their own ways that I’m proud to call my rivals in the greatest reality show of our times - /u/irishdud1, /u/401kdaytrade, /u/caddude42069, /u/Noah_Deez_Nutz \- ya’ll are goats in your own special ways. Really special ways.
* /u/IKnowTheCodings for un-knowingly challenging my ego with his [gains post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/grap5c/4_years_of_gains/) 2 years ago leading me to start posting and addicted to the titillation of internet points

**Trade Setup**

* Ever single trade was done on my iPhone 7 Plus with the TD Ameritrade app. Usually on my Toto toilet. I use Webull desktop client and TradingView website for watching charts and technical analysis during the day on a second monitor separate from my work setup
   * I’ve since upgraded to the iPhone 13 Pro Max
* My 157 stock watch list in case people find it interesting, I’m constantly scanning these to watch trends and if anything interesting catches my eye: AMPL, AAWW, ADBE, AFRM, ASTS, ARKF, AMC, ARKG, ARKK, AMZN, AAL, AI, ABNB, ASAN, AMD, AAPL, BBBY, BGFV, BKKT, BX, BAC, BMBL, BB, BUZZ, BARK, BA, BYND, BABA, CHGG, CAR, CLNE, CLF, CCL, CAKE, CVNA, CRM, CRSP, CHWY, COST, CRSR, CLOV, COIN, DWAC, DNUT, DAL, DKNG, DOCU, DDOG, DASH, DBX, DIS, ENPH, FCEL, FVRR, F, FUBO, FB, FXI, FSLY, GTLB, GS, GOOG, GME, GLD, HLTH, HOOD, HD, HEAR, IPOF, ICLN, JD, KOSS, LC, LMT, LMND, LOW, LOGI, LCID, LUV, LULU, LYFT, MRNA, MTTR, MS, MVST, MP, MTCH, MGM, MVIS, MT, MSFT, NNDM, NCLH, NUE, NKE, NIO, NET, NVDA, NFLX, OPEN, OKTA, PFE, PSFE, PRPL, PINS, POSH, PD, PLBY, PLUG, PLTR, PTON, PYPL, QS, RIVN, RTX, RIDE, RBLX, RDFN, RKT, RCL, SDC, SOFI, SLV, SPCE, SKLZ, SFT, STLD, SBUX, SHOP, SNAP, SQ, TOST, TGT, TTD, TTCF, TWTR, TNDM, TDOC, TWLO, TSLA, UPST, UWMC, UAL, UBER, U, VIAC, VALE, VRM, V, WOOF, WISH, WKHS, W, X, ZIM, Z, ZM

## Final Message for My Little Jacks

I really believe I just got very lucky.

* The initial $35K in my 401k was an accident. I actually wanted to take my annual Jan bonus in cash to buy some toys but missed the cutoff date to change it in Dec so it defaulted to throwing my annual bonus in my 401k
* Started trading in Feb 2020 as COVID created the most bi-polar volatile market ever swinging between covid and recovery stocks quickly growing $35k to $900k in 4 months, something that is irreproducible
* Continued trading as meme stocks and short squeezes shook the financial world before they re-tuned their algorithms and shortened their potency
* Literally got lucky on 4 coin-flip-type ERs in a row

Live to fight another day. If it’s good enough to screenshot, it’s good enough to sell. Don’t chase. Use independent thinking. It’s just money. 

All these sayings… all these lessons… at the end of this journey I’m still not sure what to make of it all. Life is short. Enjoy it as best you can. Try to do good. And try to be lucky.

I’ll still be around, probably not posting much but maybe some comments here and there.

It’s been an absolute **life changing** time with you all.

That blackberry is DEAD!!! The **new blackberry** since 2013 is a **pure software company** leading the cybersecurity, iot, and connected cars (EV + ICE) revolution. Many at this point are probably raising eyebrows in disbelief, that's exactly the type of reaction I get from about 8 out of 10 people. This is fault of the company for not being aggressive on consumer front in advertising but I can also see why they shied away from it. BB is a B2B company and so they have been aggressively partnering with 100s of companies to embed their SW into semiconductor, ADAS, and other iot chips/devices(cars, drones, etc 265 design wins in last 2 years). 

The new BB has 38,000 patents ([here](https://www.blackberry.com/content/dam/blackberry-com/Documents/pdf/financial-reports/2021/q4y2021/q4-fy21-transcript.pdf)), leader in Zero Trust Cybersecurity ([here](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/unified-endpoint-security)), and leader in embedded iot software ([here](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/solutions/embedded-solutions)).  

**The 38,000 patents (gold of today)**  
Now lets get back to the correct number of patents. There has been lot of speculation and confusion in the media about number of patents owned by Blackberry. Many at one point thought it was only 18,000 patents, then only 30,000 patents, but the TRUE number is staggering 38,000 patents. I have put together some sources on where i got the number from below. First the CEO confirming in Q4 FY21 earning ([here](https://www.blackberry.com/content/dam/blackberry-com/Documents/pdf/financial-reports/2021/q4y2021/q4-fy21-transcript.pdf)) to an analyst asking for the correct number. And then just in 2020(during covid shutdown) they managed to get 2,000 more patents. Like this article ([here](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=ec56f1c7-5ce9-4182-a437-0840d802cfd8)) suggest the number is closer to **40,000 patents as of TODAY**.   
 

&gt;**Trip Chowdhry, Global Equities Research:** Second question I had was regarding the intellectual property portfolio you have. The last time I counted it was more than 30,000 patents.   
&gt;  
&gt;**John Chen:** 38,000 to be exact. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Next few weeks are critical** as they plan on selling off the patent portfolio(**20k patents**) related to messaging, devices, wireless, etc since they no longer make hardware phones. JC the ceo said by end of November or before the ER on Dec 21st the company will either announce the patent deal or walk away. He has been negotiating the deal since last Christmas and now he's tired of pushing it out. If the deal goes through it will be minimum 1 Billion added to BB cash pile of $800m This will be huge for the SP as all the revenue from patent licensing is pulled up front for investment in growth. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Paul Treiber, RBC Capital Markets**  Oh, hi, John. The first question on the patent sale, I know you can’t say much just given you’re in the middle of negotiations, but your statement you mentioned that the negotiations are going well but then you also indicated that if it doesn’t close you have other options. Just could you bridge between those two statements because they’re are actually quite far apart from a tone perspective?    
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;John Chen  That’s good, that’s a good one, I’m glad you caught it. Yes, it is going well, **I fully expect to finish this, this quarter, but I’m tired of waiting**. I know a lot of our investors are too. I’m not blaming anything on anybody, and maybe we have too many lawyers assigned to this. Sorry lawyers, but the key is it’s a complex and big portfolio. It’s rightfully so that they have done a lot of due diligence, and those things are now completed by the way. All the due diligence has been completed. And then, we have a lot of time spent on definitive agreement negotiations. By and large, with the exception of one or two items, we’re done with that. And then, we have the purchase agreement. And so for me, it’s been since last Christmas. It’s coming up to next Christmas, **so I basically draw the line in the sand and say,** I can’t just stop Licensing.  **The business needs to either move in one direction or the other. And then, there are other interested parties who are calling.** We are not entertaining them, because as you recall, during a period of time not long ago in the past, we were in an exclusive discussion with these people. So, I can’t really entertain a third party. So, my only point is, if you want to put a weighing percentage, **I put 80:20, I put 80% we get it done this quarter.** Does that help?

&amp;#x200B;

**Also confirmed by Steve Rai (BB CFO) in this interview(**[**here**](https://youtu.be/L_G8gitontI?t=1820)**) that JC plans on announcing by ER one way or the other.** 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm long and strong blackberry!! I believe this is mispriced and suppressed company worth minimum 10x value today. This is not an investment advice, Please do your own DD before investing and please visit BB investor relations for more info.

WISH (E-commerce) giant  will thrive again due to COVID omicron infection rate rise daily world wide. 

Omicron more likely to reinfect than Delta, no milder -study- The risk of reinfection with the Omicron coronavirus variant is more than five times higher and it has shown no sign of being milder than Delta, a study showed, as cases soar across Europe and threaten year-end festivities. 

Cases of the new variant, which the World Health Organization first announced on Friday, have appeared in more than 50 countries as of Dec. 9. First identified by South African scientists, omicron cases have been reported from Australia and Hong Kong to Canada. The first case in the United States was confirmed on Dec. 1.

A WHO report released Sunday said the omicron variant contains a number of genetic mutations, and the organization said the variant has a high likelihood of global spread. But the organization said it’s still too early to determine whether omicron is more contagious, more deadly or more resistant to vaccines than previous Covid variants.

The United States, Japan, Israel and several countries have enacted international travel restrictions in response to the variant’s spread, though the WHO has cautioned against such bans.

The United States surpassed 50 million virus cases. Masks are required in indoor public spaces across New York State that do not require proof of vaccination for entry and will be required everywhere in California.

Researchers testing coronavirus samples in Washington State have recorded a rapid rise in cases with a mutation that is characteristic of the Omicron variant, mirroring trends that have emerged in countries like South Africa, Britain and Denmark.

Researchers at the University of Washington found that 13 percent of 217 positive coronavirus case specimens collected on Wednesday had the mutation. That was up from about 7 percent of samples they had tested from the day before, and 3 percent from the day before that — in a region that had its first identified cases only two weeks ago.

Covid News: New York Reports Record for Cases in a Day

New York officials reported 21,027 new coronavirus cases on Friday, the highest single-day total since the earliest days of pandemic, when the availability of testing was not as widespread as it is now.

The data, which reflected test results for Thursday, showed a drastic change in the virus’s presence in New York. For weeks, case counts had been rising steadily, primarily because of a winter surge driven by the Delta variant. But the spike in recent days is because of the fast-spreading Omicron variant, epidemiologists believe. 

Travel restrictions by country following the Omicron variant outbreak

TLDR : Covid News: New York Reports Record for Cases in a Day. An appeals court reinstated President Biden’s vaccine mandate for large employers. The Rockettes canceled the rest of their season, the N.F.L. rescheduled three games and the Brooklyn Nets said an unvaccinated player can take the court at away games. Wish is in perfect position to thrive, a new ceo is coming in February. New changes in wish makes a great investment to your portfolio.

JPM called qdel their short for 2022, price target $80.

Quidel increased test capacity to 600 mil tests yearly with a new factory.  Up from 45 mil tests last quarter and 20 mil tests last year.

The shorts saw that coming.

They figured making diagnostic tests was a waste of space. Who needs them?  Short the stock. Covid is just ... the flu.

Quidel is now ramping capacity to 1 billion test capacity in the Jan  quarter. That’s 50x growth. 

The shorts saw that coming, too. Shorted more. Balls of steel. They da man. Take quidel to the woodshed. 

But we do need tests. Test-to-work programs, test-to stay in school  programs, test to go the the game, test to stay at home with your kids. 

Finally the media is catching on. They debated pcr tests and rapid tests  endlessly. 

Now rapid tests may be essential pandemic tool. They are hard to make and  get approved by the fda. Covid may become endemic. Tests are here to stay. Too  few test makers.

The shorts didn’t see that coming.

JPMs short call said rapid tests face pricing pressure, competition. 

No kidding. Next year the country has 200 mil rapid tests a month capacity.  

40% of that made by quidel. Its taken a year to get the manufacturing set  up. Big machines. 

They make $2.50 a test after tax. They pay fair wages. Its not a 10-cent  test made somewhere else that gets recalled. 

The retailers/distributors make $6 a test. Price pressure would affect  retail. If there was any. 

200 million tests a month. And 333 million people. In this country.

The UK can’t find tests for their 68 mil people. I got 4 tests and some  quidel to buy more. I’ll need them.

Projection-

Shorts were wrong. Shorts must cover. Shorts will fall.

Quidel will sell out capacity- to govts, to biz with employees, to you and  me.

Quidel has a small 100 mil test contract with the govt but they cant fill  it. 

Not until sept 2022 because they are busy fulfilling other contracts. Too  much demand. For their 1 billion tests.

If they work 2 shifts, 5 days, 100 hours. But, at 168 hours at 24/7 like  they did before? 

That’s 1.68 billion tests then I guess. Tests that nobody needs. 

At a complete sell-out of 1 billion tests they make max 4.7 billion after  tax or $113 eps. 

Don’t ask about 1.68 billion tests. Its simple math. Shorts can do the  math. But who needs tests?

&amp;#x200B;

Fellow smooth brains,

Many don't see it yet, but the catalyst for a massive shortsqueeze, possibly the biggest one yet, and one that affects multiple stocks, is coming within the next few weeks. This DD will explain what it is, how it affects AMC, GME &amp; Other Stocks, and how we can profit from this knowledge. This DD is strictly based on facts and numbers. However, early data / studies had to be used, because things are progressing rapidly. If we would wait for peer reviews etc. of certain data, it would all be over and we would still be waiting. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Intro**

It has been a hard couple of weeks for many stock holders. Even some of the most battle hardened smooth brains, including me, got a bit nervous when the freefall in many of our most favorite stocks started. The good news is, that this drop is part of the setup for a massive shortsqueeze. Let me explain why.

&amp;#x200B;

**The catalyst**

Massive drops in different stocks happened when the media started hyping and spreading fear about the new Covid-19 variant, Omicron. Big and small players started to short certain (already heavily shorted) stocks even more. Their thinking is that this variant will most likely cause further lockdowns, and possibly could be the nail in the coffin for some of the companies that are most affected by the pandemic. **They are dead wrong**. Omicron is the end of the pandemic. It is a natural vaccine for covid and it will be the catalyst for multiple massive short squeezes. Let me present the data and explain everything.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Omicron Variant**

The omicron variant of SARS COVID-19 is a different beast. Extremely contagious, even for vaccinated and boosted people. Spreading like wildfire. Bad right? No, good. End of the pandemic good.

Why you ask? Because according to all knowledge and data we have, it has four distinct properties which make it the best thing that could ever happen in this pandemic (in the big picture). We will look at each of these four things individually, I will provide proof they they are indeed facts, and then we will draw our conclusions at the end:

  


**Property 1: It is more contagious and spreads faster than any other variant we ever had**

&amp;#x200B;

**Property 2: It causes very mild symptoms and it puts much less people into the hospital. People that do need to go to the hospital because of it, can leave much earlier on average than with other variants. Less ventilators are needed.**

Early studies are underway, but the virus spreads so rapidly that once the studies are finished, it will already be too late for them to be useful. The most useful thing we can do is compare cases, deaths, and emergency care utilization etc. in countries where Omicron is the prevalent variant. The UK is perfect for this. Look at how many cases and how many deaths they have

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Property 3: It replaces the deadlier variants of Covid-19 (Mostly Delta)**

Omicron, the much less harmful variant, actually replaces delta!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

What omicron basically does is it infects many, many people, fast. It causes mostly mild symptoms in exchange for immunity against covid-19. Then it is killed by the immune system. It also replaces the other variants. See where this is going? It is like a natural vaccine which spreads by itself and immunizes most of the world population, rapidly, without causing too many bad cases or deaths.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**A little bit of history**

Why are you so sure this will actually happen? You ask. 

Well, we have very, very good early data, and also because it already happened in the last real pandemic we had. The spanish flu.  


From wikipedia:  
“End of the pandemic

By 1920, the virus that caused the pandemic became much less deadly and caused only ordinary seasonal flu.”

And guess what, even the timing is similar - roughly two years.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The juicy stuff**

The pandemic short thesis is wrong. All the companies that were shorted because of the pandemic or the omicron variant - there is no reason for that anymore. The pandemic will be over, and an endemic will start once omicron has burned through the population, which will take only a few weeks, according to the early data we have.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR - Positions**

All available data suggests that omicron will be the cause for the end of the pandemic. Omicron will burn through the world population, causing mostly harmless, flu-like symptoms and provide immunity against more harmful variants. It will replace the more deadly variants. We will most likely be back to pretty much regular life, within a few weeks, months at most. The pandemic and the omicron short thesis are therefore not valid anymore. And there is no reason for the heavy shorting of certain companies. The shorts will get burned hard once the media and the masses realizes this, and stocks like GME or AMC will rocket. 

Positions:  
GME and AMC calls (End of Jan / start of Feb) &amp; shares

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Final word:**

My sincere and heartfelt condolences to everybody who has lost family or friends in this pandemic. Even though the Omicron variant is good news in the big picture, there will still people die from it, and every single death is a tragedy.

The stock price has done well in the last 6 months but I see plenty of room for it to 🚀 to the 🌝. Here’s why:

- It is pretty cheap at ~8x fwd P/E compared to other biotechs. Moderna (closest competitor?) is at 14x, even that seems cheap. If BNTX gets close to Moderna that’s already around a 100% increase.

- Booster shots booster shots booster shots. Only a matter of time before 3rd shots are authorized in the US and EU. Israel is already starting with these.

- India/China and the delta variant. Indian and Chinese vaccines are shit against the delta and there’s a good chance they will order some mRNA vax. If that happens. The demand will explode.

- New vax based on mRNA. BNTX is working on a whole host of new therapies based on their mRNA tech. Everything from flu to some cancer treatments. Seems like the TESLA of biotech.

Short term: three tailwinds
1. With yields of 10 y so low many conservative investors are flocking to dividend stocks. Gilead with a yield of 4% which is very safe given the consistent cash flow will be one of the top options
2. Third quarter earnings. Gilead has a revenue of 5 billion without remdesivir which will be unchanged this quarter : loss in hep C made up with more PrEP and oncology sales, but with hospitalizations all across the western world high remdesivir will bring in an extra 1.5 billion in revenue. This quarter will likely represent the peak remdesivir revenue. As it’s the only fda approved drug for covid no additional money is spent on sg&amp;a and is directly going to be bottom line. Expect to see an EPS of around $2 a share which is much above the estimates of $1.6 a share
3. FDA is reviewing more car-t cell indications for Kite’s drugs. (Kite is a Gilead subsidiary). This will get approved as the data is very convincing. As these hematologist malignancies are hard to treat there’s a huge market for these two car-t cell drugs
- [ ] 
Long term outlook 
Basically with remdesivir Gilead was able to brush up a drug with no clinical use and make 10 billion ( the total sales of it should be at least this number, with almost 6 billion already sold).  They can pay off their debt which is low interest very easily. The oncology program is getting stronger and with trodlevy being a first in class drug, it can open to a multi billion dollar industry. The newer hiv drugs: lenecapavir ( which can be used just once a month!) is going to completely  monopolize the hiv market and will be able to command a higher fee than biktarvy which is used in 50% hiv patients. So I expect both the margin and amount of patients on a Gilead product to increase in the hiv market

If a new analysis of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) proves accurate, the already-popular retail stock is poised to nearly double very soon. Brian Nowak, an analyst at ever-influential investment bank Morgan Stanley, issued a research note Monday in which he said that in a best-case scenario, the stock could hit $6,000 per share in 2023. That's a whopping 83% above the present level.
Nowak bases his argument on the price/earnings to growth (PEG) rates of other top retailers and consumer goods staples companies, many of which hover around 3.

\- May 13  EPS of -$1.95, Revenue of  $886.9M (+5.4% Y/Y) 

 Airbnb attracted over $10B of bookings in Q1 2021, an increase of over 50% from the same prior year period as travel returns.

# ABNB Business

Tech company based in silicon valley that offers the home of people who want to rent it for small periods of times, to people who want to travel or work.

The houses they offer are inspected and well photographed so guests know what they are renting.

They profit from a fee of \~10% from the guest.

Currently ABNB has 4Million hosts from all around the globe.

Since covid ABNB has expanded their business to other areas like experiences (cooking, pets, sailing, surf, food/wine tasting).

Usually their hosts offer houses that are competitive to hotels but may lack hotel normal services (except cleaning)

Airbnb offer insurance up to 1Million dollars in case guests damage the property, recent case from a party in Dallas, which led to airbnb ban parties and guests who might be into parties.

Airbnb model protects them from house expenses, in a covid world they have no expenses with unrented houses and rooms unlike hotels.

# ABNB keeps it Safe

As you can see trusting your house to strangers might not be relaxing, thus Airbnb needs to offer a safe ecosystem of people who can be trusted.

Hosts need to be sure their property will be intact and guests want to get what they paid for.

For that Airbnb has a method of rating, both host and guest will review one another. In this process they can filter out the worst guests and hosts, and keep the good ones.

Creating this environment is important for hosts, as they can know, how the guests they are receiving, have behaved in previous houses. 

Leads to less uncertainty and more focus on making their property more appealing to well behaved guests.

I am generally risk averse. I hate losing $100 at the casino, I hate paying extra for guac at chipotles, I will return something or price match an item for a few dollars of savings. I am generally frugal.

But, I somehow had no issues losing 10k in options...

How I started

I remember my first trades like they were yesterday. I was trading the first hydrogen run-up in 2014 (FCEL, BLDP, PLUG) and made a few hundred dollars over a couple weeks.

I quickly progressed to penny stocks / biotech binary events and general stock market gambling mid-2014. I was making a few % here and there but the trend was down in total account value. I was the king of buying the peak in run-ups.  I managed to make it out of 2014 close to break-even to slightly down.

WSB Era

March 2015 was my first option trade. It was an AXP - American Express - monthly option trade. I saw one of the regular option traders/services post a block of 10,000 calls that had been bought for 1.3 and I followed the trade with 10 call options for a total of $1300.

I woke up the next day to an analyst upgrade on AXP and was up 50% on my position. I was addicted! I day-dreamed for days about my AXP over night success. I think around that time there was some sort of Buffet buyout of Heinz and an option trade that was up a ridiculous amount of %%%. I wanted to hit it BIG.

I came up with the idea that all I needed to reach my goal was a few 100% over night gains/ 1k&gt;2k&gt;4k&gt;8k&gt; etc. I convinced myself that I would have no problems being patient for the exact criteria that I had set and worked on some other trades.

Remember, the first win is always free. 

I was trading options pretty regularly from March 2015 until August 2016. During my best week I was up 20k and could feel the milli within reach. I can remember the exact option trade (HTZ) and I was trading weeklies on it.

For those who have been in the market long enough, you will remember the huge drawdown of August 2015. 

I lost half my account value on QCOM calls (100 of them) that I followed at the beginning of July and never materialized. I watched them eventually go to 0. It was another 10,000 block that was probably a hedge or sold.

In August 2015 there were some issues with China and all of us woke up to stocks gapping down huge.  Unfortunately my idea of buying far dated calls during the following days/weeks after the crash went sideways. I quickly learned that an increase in volatility causes a rise in option prices and I was paying a premium for calls that were going to lose value very quickly (the infamous IV crush).

I kept trading options into the end of 2015 and managed to maintain my account value positive but the trading fees for the year amounted to $30,000+. My broker was loving it.

I tried all the services, all the strategies. I created rules for my option plays:
1. No earnings
2. Only follow the big buys at a discount (10,000 blocks or more).
3. No weekly options
4. Take profit right away
5. Take losses quickly
6. etc.

I had a whole note book of option plays that I was writing down and following. I was paying for option services that all of you know about - remember, they make money on the services and not trading.

I even figured out a loop-hole with my broker: if I didn’t have enough money in my account, I could change my ask price to .01 and then change it to market buy and I would only need to accept a warning ⚠️ for the order to go through. I was able to day trade the option and make money, who cares if I didnt have enough? After a few months of this, I got a call from my broker that told me to stop and that I would be suspended if I continued with this.

By the way, I was always able to satisfy the debit on the account - so it wasn’t an issue of lack of funds.

Lost it all. Started taking money from lines of credits, every penny that I earned and losing it quicker and quicker. 

I was a full on gambler but I was convinced that 8 trades would offset all the losses. I kept getting drawn in to the idea that I could hit a homerun and make it out a hero.

I eventually hit rock bottom on some weekly expiring FSLR options that I bought hours before expiration and said to myself - what the f are you doing? I resolved to invest for the long term and stop throwing tendies away.

The feeling was reinforced during the birth of my first born and I thought - what a loser this kid will think of me if he knew how much I was gambling and wasting my life. It was a really powerful moment looking at my kid and reflecting on this idea.

I decided at that point I was going to save every penny I had and invest it on new issues with potential. 

Fall 2016

TTD, COUP and NTNX IPO ‘ed I decided I was going to throw every dollar at these and did so for the next few months. I eventually started using margin (up to 215%) and buying these for the next 6 months. They paid out and managed to make it over 100k within the year. 

The first 100k was hard but once I crossed it, I never fell below this magic number.

2017 - I did some day trading but it was mostly obsessing over the above issues. I did gamble on a few options here and there but never more than 1k.

2018 - SFIX was my big winner, I bought a gap up in June 2018 and my combined account value had crossed 400k by August 2018. I was really struggling at crossing the 500k account value and experienced 3 x 30-40% drawdowns over the next 2 years before I finally crossed the 500k barrier and have never looked back.

I still made some mistakes over the next few months - AKAO &amp; GSUM come to mind. Both of these resulted in 20k+ losses. Fortunately my winners were much bigger than my losers.

I thought about giving up and moving to index funds - but i was doing well - just experiencing large drawdowns because of leverage. 

2019 big winners were CRON SWAV STNE. 

2017 / 2018 / 2019 all had six digit capital gains on my tax returns. 

At the beginning of 2020 I was still day trading on margin (180-220%) and got a call from my broker that they were tightening up my margin as my account was analyzed by the risk department and deemed too risky. Believe it or not this was right before the covid crash. I brought my margin down to 100-110% of account value and even though the drawdown from covid hit hard, I wasn’t wiped out. 

I stayed the course and bought FSLY / RH during the big march drawdown and this resulted in some nice gains over the next few months.

I am constantly changing and testing my investment strategy but let me tell you that obsessing over 1 or 2 ideas and throwing every penny at it and holding for a few years is the best strategy. It may not work at some point but right now it does.

I still day trade but I trade with 10k or less on each individual position. It allows me minimize my losses and my winners are 1-7%. I am able to consistently make between 3-700$/ a day on day trades using the above strategy. I still take losses and still dream about hitting it big with an option trade but dont feel the need to put it all on the line every month / week.

I finally crossed into the two , club. I know people are going to ask for proof or ban but I am not earning anything for posting and the details about some of the trades should be proof enough that I kept a detailed journal of it all. I have way more to write but these are the highlights.

TL:DR - I gambled, lost it all and gambled some more lost more. I made it out alive. I have only sold calls/puts lately. 

The one common denominator in all successful people is how much they obsess over 1 or 2 ideas. Do the same.  All the winners on this sub have gone all in on one idea (FSLY / TSLA ).

Going to keep this simple. EDIT: this isn’t simple and I should write a short story on this.

I am generally risk averse. I hate losing $100 at the casino, I hate paying extra for guac at chipotles, I will return something or price match an item for a few dollars of savings. I am generally frugal.

But, I somehow had no issues losing 10k in options...

How I started

I remember my first trades like they were yesterday. I was trading the first hydrogen run-up in 2014 (FCEL, BLDP, PLUG) and made a few hundred dollars over a couple weeks.

I quickly progressed to penny stocks / biotech binary events and general stock market gambling mid-2014. I was making a few % here and there but the trend was down in total account value. I was the king of buying the peak in run-ups.  I managed to make it out of 2014 close to break-even to slightly down.

WSB Era

March 2015 was my first option trade. It was an AXP - American Express - monthly option trade. I saw one of the regular option traders/services post a block of 10,000 calls that had been bought for 1.3 and I followed the trade with 10 call options for a total of $1300.

I woke up the next day to an analyst upgrade on AXP and was up 50% on my position. I was addicted! I day-dreamed for days about my AXP over night success. I think around that time there was some sort of Buffet buyout of Heinz and an option trade that was up a ridiculous amount of %%%. I wanted to hit it BIG.

I came up with the idea that all I needed to reach my goal was a few 100% over night gains/ 1k&gt;2k&gt;4k&gt;8k&gt; etc. I convinced myself that I would have no problems being patient for the exact criteria that I had set and worked on some other trades.

Remember, the first win is always free. 

I was trading options pretty regularly from March 2015 until August 2016. During my best week I was up 20k and could feel the milli within reach. I can remember the exact option trade (HTZ) and I was trading weeklies on it.

For those who have been in the market long enough, you will remember the huge drawdown of August 2015. 

I lost half my account value on QCOM calls (100 of them) that I followed at the beginning of July and never materialized. I watched them eventually go to 0. It was another 10,000 block that was probably a hedge or sold.

In August 2015 there were some issues with China and all of us woke up to stocks gapping down huge.  Unfortunately my idea of buying far dated calls during the following days/weeks after the crash went sideways. I quickly learned that an increase in volatility causes a rise in option prices and I was paying a premium for calls that were going to lose value very quickly (the infamous IV crush).

I kept trading options into the end of 2015 and managed to maintain my account value positive but the trading fees for the year amounted to $30,000+. My broker was loving it.

I tried all the services, all the strategies. I created rules for my option plays:
1. No earnings
2. Only follow the big buys at a discount (10,000 blocks or more).
3. No weekly options
4. Take profit right away
5. Take losses quickly
6. etc.

I had a whole note book of option plays that I was writing down and following. I was paying for option services that all of you know about - remember, they make money on the services and not trading.

I even figured out a loop-hole with my broker: if I didn’t have enough money in my account, I could change my ask price to .01 and then change it to market buy and I would only need to accept a warning ⚠️ for the order to go through. I was able to day trade the option and make money, who cares if I didnt have enough? After a few months of this, I got a call from my broker that told me to stop and that I would be suspended if I continued with this.

By the way, I was always able to satisfy the debit on the account - so it wasn’t an issue of lack of funds.

Lost it all. Started taking money from lines of credits, every penny that I earned and losing it quicker and quicker. 

I was a full on gambler but I was convinced that 8 trades would offset all the losses. I kept getting drawn in to the idea that I could hit a homerun and make it out a hero.

I eventually hit rock bottom on some weekly expiring FSLR options that I bought hours before expiration and said to myself - what the f are you doing? I resolved to invest for the long term and stop throwing tendies away.

The feeling was reinforced during the birth of my first born and I thought - what a loser this kid will think of me if he knew how much I was gambling and wasting my life. It was a really powerful moment looking at my kid and reflecting on this idea.

I decided at that point I was going to save every penny I had and invest it on new issues with potential. 

Fall 2016

TTD, COUP and NTNX IPO ‘ed I decided I was going to throw every dollar at these and did so for the next few months. I eventually started using margin (up to 215%) and buying these for the next 6 months. They paid out and managed to make it over 100k within the year. 

The first 100k was hard but once I crossed it, I never fell below this magic number.

2017 - I did some day trading but it was mostly obsessing over the above issues. I did gamble on a few options here and there but never more than 1k.

2018 - SFIX was my big winner, I bought a gap up in June 2018 and my combined account value had crossed 400k by August 2018. I was really struggling at crossing the 500k account value and experienced 3 x 30-40% drawdowns over the next 2 years before I finally crossed the 500k barrier and have never looked back.

I still made some mistakes over the next few months - AKAO &amp; GSUM come to mind. Both of these resulted in 20k+ losses. Fortunately my winners were much bigger than my losers.

I thought about giving up and moving to index funds - but i was doing well - just experiencing large drawdowns because of leverage. 

2019 big winners were CRON SWAV STNE. 

2017 / 2018 / 2019 all had six digit capital gains on my tax returns. 

At the beginning of 2020 I was still day trading on margin (180-220%) and got a call from my broker that they were tightening up my margin as my account was analyzed by the risk department and deemed too risky. Believe it or not this was right before the covid crash. I brought my margin down to 100-110% of account value and even though the drawdown from covid hit hard, I wasn’t wiped out. 

I stayed the course and bought FSLY / RH during the big march drawdown and this resulted in some nice gains over the next few months.

I am constantly changing and testing my investment strategy but let me tell you that obsessing over 1 or 2 ideas and throwing every penny at it and holding for a few years is the best strategy. It may not work at some point but right now it does.

I still day trade but I trade with 10k or less on each individual position. It allows me minimize my losses and my winners are 1-7%. I am able to consistently make between 3-700$/ a day on day trades using the above strategy. I still take losses and still dream about hitting it big with an option trade but dont feel the need to put it all on the line every month / week.

I finally crossed into the two , club. I know people are going to ask for proof or ban but I am not earning anything for posting and the details about some of the trades should be proof enough that I kept a detailed journal of it all. I have way more to write but these are the highlights.

Eventually I will share how I build a position in a story I love. I still sell buy and sell to early but I am working on improving. 

TL:DR - I gambled, lost it all and gambled some more lost more. I made it out alive. I have only sold calls/puts lately.

I've been thinking long and hard (that's what she said) about what the next retard bets in terms of stocks could look like and I wanted to get some input from the most retarded apes I could think of.

My idea was to A) imagine a post-covid world and b) deviate a little from the classic 'airline stocks will come back' formula.

So the things I could come up with so far is sawmill companies (heard about it on the news so I think that ship has already sailed), supply companies for different sectors (Napkins for Sports events or Fast food restaurants or  things like that), and of course the sports and entertainment promoters themselves. The U.S. is looking more and more like a pre-pandemic world (not really, I know. But you guys have sport events in front of audiences and NYC might open up again soon) but europe is actually lagging behind somewhat. I think there might be some decent bets to be made on things people at-large don't think about yet.

What's your opinion on this? Am I full of shit (certainly), way too late to the party (usually I cum first every time) or could I be onto something? 

And do you have any ideas on what those undervalued sectors could be?

Firstly, I want to thank everyone who commented constructively yesterday on [my initial AMC DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljz99b/amc_blockbuster_dd/). A lot of good input and questions. I thought it'd be best to try and summarize/address a lot of the concerns raised in a second DD, where I can get more into the details, in advance of the market opening tomorrow.

This sequel DD is split in Fundamentals and Mementals. A tl;dr is at the top of each section. At the bottom you'll find my thoughts on catalysts and forward momentum drivers. You don't have to agree, that's just how I see things. I'm not trying to convince anyone. My position is 15,000 shares at about $2.40 price. For those who wonder why I didn't sell at the squeeze: I bought the shares before the stock started mooning and had sold covered calls. It was too expensive to get out of them, so I was rolling them up. Unfortunately for me, the squeeze subsided before I could extract myself from the calls, so I'm still in, and at a substantial unrealized profit as well. **My horizon is up to the end of 2021 the latest, so I'm only assessing the potential for the share price to go up until then** \- I'm not in it for years. I'll probably sell some CSPs in the meantime and if it stabilizes higher by June or earlier I'll sell some CCs for income.

I'll preface this DD by saying that in 2020, and it looks like in 2021 as well, fundamentals don't mean much one way or another in my opinion. It's pure moment trading in the market from what I gather and everything is overvalued. Every-fucking-thing is overvalued, so saying that a company's fundamentals aren't that great means shit when you got stocks with $bn market caps which have never turned a profit, have no product and won't sell anything for years to come. Investors are looking for what's least overvalued, or what may benefit from momentum over the next few weeks/months and jump on it as soon as possible. Today 2/15 the markets were closed in N.America, but Europe was open and anything related to post-Covid normalcy skyrocketed. All leisure/travel stocks mooned even though noone is travelling yet. I do really expect something like this will be happening in the american stock market very soon, if not immediately, as well. People will try to position themselves for the post-covid times as sentiment shifts to positive. I expect big rotations out of tech stocks and likewise into leisure/travel/socializing and back-to-business stocks. I do think AMC is one of the beneficiaries, irrespective of fundamentals or not.

Finally, all my figures are taken from the company's own annual report unless stated otherwise.

&amp;#x200B;

# Fundamentals:

**tl;dr = if AMC does not change strategy it will stagnate and it's share price will not move much. I think $5 is the bottom anyways so getting in at this price point is fairly low risk. Should the price drop more after buying in you can make up the difference with CCs over a few months. Should it stay where it's at, again, selling CCs is a nice way to make money. But don't sell CCs just yet, because when it rallies you'll be trapped. Wait until it's price stabilizes.**

Onto the details:

Let's get something out of the way really quickly. AMC reaching meme status did not do anything for its solvency. Nothing, nada, 0. AMC had managed to raised capital through debt and equity BEFORE it became a meme, so shut up with that bullshit and google the timelines. Their CEO had announced that bankruptcy is off the table way before the stock took off.

&amp;#x200B;

Some share prices for your pleasure and education:

*Processing img 1x6u00gl0qh61...*

**Highlights:**

Mar 2015: **$35** @ 97.5m shares outsatnding by year end

Jan 2015: **$22** @ 97.5m shares outsatnding by year end

Dec 2016: **$35** @ 128m shares oustanding by year end

March 2017: **$31.5** @ 128m shares oustanding by year end

Aug 2017: **$13** @ 128m shares oustanding by year end (20.3m shares issued in Feb at @ $31.5)

Sept 2018: **$21** @ 104m shares outstanding by year end (retired 24m shares in Sept @ $17.5)

July 2019: **$9.5** @ 104m shares outstanding by year end

&amp;#x200B;

The above is some food for thought for those who say that AMC has diluted itself so much the price will stay forever low. As you see, the AMC share price has fluctuated wildly despite being diluted in the past, and despite revenues and profits not growing much. Therefore anyone who says this will go to $1 because of debt or dilution is talking out of their ass and is too ashamed to say they are a bear. The price has gone up and down despite being diluted and borrowing increasing, and it will go up and down again. The question is what will drive it either way.

&amp;#x200B;

Shares dilution from 2020 onwards:

* Feb 21st 2020: 52.5m Class A and 51.7m Class B
* Jan 2021: 287m Class A and 51.8m Class B
* Jan 2021: 44.4m shares added due to convertible bonds sold as shares
* 2/15/21 estimated shares outstanding are: 287m+51.8m+44.4m = 383.2m (my estimate, could be wrong)

Note: there is a difference between shares outstanding and float. Float is what is available to buy in the market, which is of interest when you start thinking about short interest.

&amp;#x200B;

According to the following sites:

* [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMC)
* [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc)
* [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/key-statistics/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/key-statistics/)
* [https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMC?mod=searchresults\_companyquotes](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMC?mod=searchresults_companyquotes)
* [https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/amc-stock](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/amc-stock)

Float is between 56.1m to 115m depending on where you look.

Btw, they all quote shares outstanding as 287m, so maybe I'm double counting something?

&amp;#x200B;

Short interest:

According to these sites the short interest ranges from:

* [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/short-interest/)
* [https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AMC.htm](https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AMC.htm)
* [https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest](https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest)
* [https://docoh.com/news/benzinga/19561873/top-30-high-short-interest](https://docoh.com/news/benzinga/19561873/top-30-high-short-interest)

37.7m shares and some quote 79% of float. Clearly a lot of sites are calculating float as 56.1m.

If anyone has any official sources on short interest it'd be great to see. In any case, I'm not advocating that this will be short squeezed. That has nothing to do with my thesis. On 2/25 the Q4 ER is taking place so we'll have a definitive answer on shares outstanding.

**Tickets, sales, customers:**

2019 = 356m consumers

2019 = NYC, LA and Chicago represent 17% of USA total box office. AMC holds 39% market share there.

[2019 annual report](https://preview.redd.it/mxpbc9wp0qh61.png?width=1664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bcac6e37fa3fa23c30d671ac3a42c8ddb859237)

It appears that there are y.o.y fluctuations on attendance. Adjusting the 2010 box office revenue for inflation ([https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/)) would result in 2019 sales of $12.5bn, when real sales were $11.4bn. Therefore, when adjusted for inflation the box office sales are not keeping up. However, it's worth noting that neither the ticket price nor the indoor screens have increased by inflation, and looking at the figures AMC is making more money per screen. I believe the reason why box office sales haven't kept up to inflation is because the strategy for theatres has been stale. I also want to believe that COVID has been a wake up call for the theatre industry to diversity and execute on more bold strategies, which combined with cost cutting measures should pay off going forward.

**Competition:**

2019 annual report = the 3 largest exhibitors are AMC, Regal (now bought out and turned private) and Cinemark, which account for 60% of box office revenues. Back in 2000 they accounted for 35% of revenues, so there is substantial consolidation happening.

Non-theatrical competition is of course the streaming services, cable tv, pay-per-view etc. In reality it's only streaming services as pay-per-view and cable tv is dead as a dodo.

Current (2021) peers are IMAX, Regal and Cinemark.

**Ops:**

2019 annual report: 1,004 theatres (636 in US) and 11,041 screens (8,094 in US). The rest are in Europe and Saudi Arabia. Market leader in USA and Europe.

26% of their revenue comes from int'l market. Europe is reopening fast and the UK GBP (biggest int'l market for AMC) is increasing in value, which in combo with a weak US dollar will bolster revenue figures.

A lot of people commented on AMC not making money and that it's doomed etc. Looking at their financials:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4am3oenr0qh61.png?width=1236&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d128de7c97c295f2552e4ca95d068c43f42ed8e

It seems to me that the biggest bummers with regard to their operating income have been rent and Opex. Rent expenses went up purely due to accounting standards, but the end result is that it made their EBITDA look worse. Should accounting treatment rules had not changed their 2019 EBITDA would have been very close to 2018.

*Note: in one of my responses to a comment in my previous DD I erroneously suggested (that's what I thought) that the capex servicing and SG&amp;A were what was dragging them down, but that seems to remain stable year on year - which are of course dragging them down, but are not what causes fluctuations in their yearly profitability.*

Now, we know that AMC has done a lot of work to keep rent costs down, and has done massive strides to reduce OPEX. Hence why I strongly think the profitability margins will improve going forward, all else remaining equal. Just look at the int'l markets where OPEX was the reverse (4.3% down y.o.y) and how it made all the difference in their bottom line. Add to that the fact they have gotten rid of a lot of underperforming screens. OPEX should go further down as everyone gets vaccinated and any additional spending on COVID sanitizing is no longer necessary.

**Capex:**

Between 2015-2019 AMC has built 37 new theatres with 310 new screens and bought out 700 theatres and 6,500 screens. They have doubled their capacity in 5 years. That's a lot of CAPEX spending, and obviously a lot of borrowing to deliver that.

Capital spending was $0.5bn in 2019, $0.6bn in 2018 and $0.6bn in 2017. This is resulting to about $300m cash outflows to serve that capex, per year from 2020 and onwards.

It appears that capital spending has stopped, so at least no more new servicing costs.

**Debt:**

2019 = $4.8bn

2020 (9/30): $5.82bn, but we know that in 2021 about $600m was converted to shares, so debt should be about $5.2bn currently. Again, if I've missed any bonds let me know.

**Comparables:**

Price to Book (ttm) and 5yr avrg:

AMC -0.26 / 1.16

MSGE 0.85 / 0.63

CNK 2.41 / 3.12

IMAX 3.34 / 3.54

AMC has the lowest valued share price amongst its competitors, therefore appears the cheapest across the peers. It also trades far lower compares to its 5yr average compared to its peers. Should the tide change it should see its price equalize to the others then there is a great upside. You may say that AMC has a lot of debt etc., well the rest are not in a much better position, with CNK being screwed with Regal for instance.

&amp;#x200B;

# Mementals:

**tl;dr: A lot of positive catalysts await, and every single piece of news will boost the price. Aside a resurge of COVID there is nothing stopping people returning to the theatres, and a slew of blockbusters will be coming out soon to entice them. A change of strategy should also help add some growth to the revenue which will only boost prices further.**

If we were to ignore fundamentals, like the rest of the market does, then we need to look at AMCs potential for popping, squeezing or rallying. I'll start by saying I don't think a short squeeze is in the books. I just doubt it. There's a lot of confusion around its short interest and float. What I do know is that the float has increased a lot compared to early 2020, but it appears that short interest has increased as well. I don't think that shorts have covered to a large extent since mid-Jan and I can see - through checking the IBKR availability of shares to borrow - that shorts are hitting it every day. It's worth noting that its share price is now 100%+ higher than were it was when they were shorting it, so who knows, but I don't count on it.

What I'm thinking is catalysts that will push the price upwards. I do expect that people are just gagging to go back to the cinema. That's not going to change once things reopen. Things that I expect will make the price rally:

\- COVID vaccine roll-out proceeds well and movie studios decide to finally start releasing movies. That should happen once capacity restrictions are lifted at movie theatres. There will be a big marketing push around this in the news.

\- NYC and LA announcing the reopening of theatres at full capacity. This will happen and will happen soon. It will lift the price by a lot as those two are the price revenue makers for AMC.

\- Partnership with a major streaming service. Netflix, Amazon or Disney, or even bought up by a major movie studio. The synergies are insane and the worst case scenario for those giants' balance sheets is negligible. Streaming service subscription numbers are stagnating and streaming giants are forced to increase prices (hi Netflix) to make up for growth. Expanding through an acquisition of AMC makes sense to reach out and grow further. It'll be like Amazon buying up Walmart. Low chance but even chatter about it will push the price up fast.

\- Summer (and Xmas) are the prime seasons where studios release movies. This summer should be huge in terms of releases and times well with the reopening of theatres. This is guaranteed.

\- Wanda converted their shares and is no longer the controlling shareholder. This allows substantial more maneouvering ability to the executive team to do things differently.

\- COVID restrictions lifted sooner than expected. This will allow AMC to use the cash pile it has squirreled for a tough 2021 in repaying debt faster, reducing interest expenses and improving its net income. Any announcement around retiring debt will push the price up.

\- More strategic changes towards PVOD, eSPORTS, booking theatres to people through apps etc. to utilize all the spare seating capacity. Even at peak revenue AMC is only using 17% of its seats, so it's got a lot of idle capacity it can make money off with 0 additional costs. AMC should pivot to additional offerings on top of movie releases to capture more footfall in its screens. I do believe that COVID was a wake up call that will push them to more innovative ways of generating revenue.

\- As people return to theatres they will realize a lot of locals have shut down. There will be consolidation due to natural causes. Fewer screens but the same number of movie-goers. That's a benefit for AMC.

\- With sentiment improving around the economy reopening a lot of these stocks that were hit hard by Covid will get extreme tailwinds that will make them rally. Look at what happened when the Pfizer vaccine was announced with the massive rotation out of tech stocks. I expect similar moves, sooner rather than later. Biden is doing a decent job with vaccine roll out.

I believe that $5 is the new bottom of the share and I think we will be seeing a lot of weekly pops with small pullbacks, basically higher highs and higher lows, going forward. If you actively manage your position you may be able to exit at the high points and reenter at the pullbacks for additional profit.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't see any negatives aside from COVID resurging for some reason. I do believe that the very worst is past for the theatre business.

&amp;#x200B;

**Finally, let me address some common comments:**

\- I got Netflix, why would I go to the movies?

You've had netflix for years, yet you (and everyone else) still goes to the movies. The movies are not gonna die anytime soon. Worst case they won't grow and stagnate, but they are here for years to come.

&amp;#x200B;

\- The studios will just offer their movies to streaming and not to theatres.

Absolute bullshit. Theatres are doing the opposite, pulling out catalogs from netflix. They are in a conundrum as they don't really know what to do. They don't want their movies streaming (because it's far, FAAAAAR less revenue for them) through 3rd parties but at the same time cannot create their own platforms to stream. The latter is just stupid. The CAPEX required to build your own platform is high, and the benefit is trivial since they can play movies in theatres and keep the majority of the ticket price. Besides, streaming movies only works for low budget films. Any blockbuster requires the cinematic experience. Very few people have top-model TVs at home with surround sound, and even if they do, 4K streamed over the internet results to sub-par quality. It just does not compare to the cinema quality. The only realistic alternative to cinema for home entertainment is having a top of the line tv+sound+bluray. But that's not streaming is it?

If streaming was to kill off theatres then VHS, DVD and Bluray would have done so before (Studios would have released straight to DVD, why didn't they?). It never happened and for good reason. People go to the movies because of a) The cinematic experience, b) they combine it with a night out, c) it's a way of socializing and much more. That won't go away. Btw, Disney, despite having a streaming platform decided to go ahead with theatrical releases of all its movies in 2021, and won't offer them on streaming at the same time. Get it now?

Another reason why that won't work = Look at Disney, they offered Mulan through their own platform, so what best example to examine. They did not offer it as part of the subscription, so forget about paying your monthly neftlix and having new movies for free. They instead priced it at about 2x movie tickets. Even if they are to continue that with their next releases it's not really that much more affordable compared to going to the movies, is it? So don't expect Universal or 20th Century offering you all their new movies for $10/month. Ain't gonna happen.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Theatres have been open since August but noone is going

Noone is going not only because of COVID concerns, but there are no movies to see. You need studios to release their movies for people to return. I don't expect them to do so until restrictions are lifted and everyone can safely return to the theatres.

&amp;#x200B;

\- So, what else besides James Bond is coming in 2021? why would I go to the cinema for just 1 movie.

You are an idiot. Here is a list of upcoming blockbuster releases: [https://qz.com/1948011/the-2021-movie-calendar-previews-hollywoods-new-normal/](https://qz.com/1948011/the-2021-movie-calendar-previews-hollywoods-new-normal/)

Look at summer time onwards, there is a hot movie almost every week. Most of the movies in the first half will likely be released in the second half after all, making it a bonanza of new films coming out in summer onwards.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Theatres are dead in the long term, aren't they?

We are all dead in the long term. I don't care. Let's focus in the next six months ok? My investment horizon for AMC is up to the end of 2021 the latest. In a best case scenario I expect the recovery to be fully priced in by summer time when I will exit or just start selling CCs again. I may exit/renter several times to what I think may be short-term peaks and troughs. I'm not Buffett so I'm not buying for life. I'm in this for the rally to normalcy.

&amp;#x200B;

\###I may edit this post at the bottom to address any recurring comments.

Do not make any investment decisions based on the whatever I post online or say.**",AMC Blockbuster DD: The Sequel,166,1,"AMC Blockbuster DD: The Sequel **Disclaimer: None of the below is investment advice. Do not make any investment decisions based on the whatever I post online or say.**

Firstly, I want to thank everyone who commented constructively yesterday on [my initial AMC DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljz99b/amc_blockbuster_dd/). A lot of good input and questions. I thought it'd be best to try and summarize/address a lot of the concerns raised in a second DD, where I can get more into the details, in advance of the market opening tomorrow.

This sequel DD is split in Fundamentals and Mementals. A tl;dr is at the top of each section. At the bottom you'll find my thoughts on catalysts and forward momentum drivers. You don't have to agree, that's just how I see things. I'm not trying to convince anyone. My position is 15,000 shares at about $2.40 price. For those who wonder why I didn't sell at the squeeze: I bought the shares before the stock started mooning and had sold covered calls. It was too expensive to get out of them, so I was rolling them up. Unfortunately for me, the squeeze subsided before I could extract myself from the calls, so I'm still in, and at a substantial unrealized profit as well. **My horizon is up to the end of 2021 the latest, so I'm only assessing the potential for the share price to go up until then** \- I'm not in it for years. I'll probably sell some CSPs in the meantime and if it stabilizes higher by June or earlier I'll sell some CCs for income.

I'll preface this DD by saying that in 2020, and it looks like in 2021 as well, fundamentals don't mean much one way or another in my opinion. It's pure moment trading in the market from what I gather and everything is overvalued. Every-fucking-thing is overvalued, so saying that a company's fundamentals aren't that great means shit when you got stocks with $bn market caps which have never turned a profit, have no product and won't sell anything for years to come. Investors are looking for what's least overvalued, or what may benefit from momentum over the next few weeks/months and jump on it as soon as possible. Today 2/15 the markets were closed in N.America, but Europe was open and anything related to post-Covid normalcy skyrocketed. All leisure/travel stocks mooned even though noone is travelling yet. I do really expect something like this will be happening in the american stock market very soon, if not immediately, as well. People will try to position themselves for the post-covid times as sentiment shifts to positive. I expect big rotations out of tech stocks and likewise into leisure/travel/socializing and back-to-business stocks. I do think AMC is one of the beneficiaries, irrespective of fundamentals or not.

Finally, all my figures are taken from the company's own annual report unless stated otherwise.

&amp;#x200B;

# Fundamentals:

**tl;dr = if AMC does not change strategy it will stagnate and it's share price will not move much. I think $5 is the bottom anyways so getting in at this price point is fairly low risk. Should the price drop more after buying in you can make up the difference with CCs over a few months. Should it stay where it's at, again, selling CCs is a nice way to make money. But don't sell CCs just yet, because when it rallies you'll be trapped. Wait until it's price stabilizes.**

Onto the details:

Let's get something out of the way really quickly. AMC reaching meme status did not do anything for its solvency. Nothing, nada, 0. AMC had managed to raised capital through debt and equity BEFORE it became a meme, so shut up with that bullshit and google the timelines. Their CEO had announced that bankruptcy is off the table way before the stock took off.

&amp;#x200B;

Some share prices for your pleasure and education:

*Processing img 1x6u00gl0qh61...*

**Highlights:**

Mar 2015: **$35** @ 97.5m shares outsatnding by year end

Jan 2015: **$22** @ 97.5m shares outsatnding by year end

Dec 2016: **$35** @ 128m shares oustanding by year end

March 2017: **$31.5** @ 128m shares oustanding by year end

Aug 2017: **$13** @ 128m shares oustanding by year end (20.3m shares issued in Feb at @ $31.5)

Sept 2018: **$21** @ 104m shares outstanding by year end (retired 24m shares in Sept @ $17.5)

July 2019: **$9.5** @ 104m shares outstanding by year end

&amp;#x200B;

The above is some food for thought for those who say that AMC has diluted itself so much the price will stay forever low. As you see, the AMC share price has fluctuated wildly despite being diluted in the past, and despite revenues and profits not growing much. Therefore anyone who says this will go to $1 because of debt or dilution is talking out of their ass and is too ashamed to say they are a bear. The price has gone up and down despite being diluted and borrowing increasing, and it will go up and down again. The question is what will drive it either way.

&amp;#x200B;

Shares dilution from 2020 onwards:

* Feb 21st 2020: 52.5m Class A and 51.7m Class B
* Jan 2021: 287m Class A and 51.8m Class B
* Jan 2021: 44.4m shares added due to convertible bonds sold as shares
* 2/15/21 estimated shares outstanding are: 287m+51.8m+44.4m = 383.2m (my estimate, could be wrong)

Note: there is a difference between shares outstanding and float. Float is what is available to buy in the market, which is of interest when you start thinking about short interest.

&amp;#x200B;

According to the following sites:

* [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMC)
* [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc)
* [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/key-statistics/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/key-statistics/)
* [https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMC?mod=searchresults\_companyquotes](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMC?mod=searchresults_companyquotes)
* [https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/amc-stock](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/amc-stock)

Float is between 56.1m to 115m depending on where you look.

Btw, they all quote shares outstanding as 287m, so maybe I'm double counting something?

&amp;#x200B;

Short interest:

According to these sites the short interest ranges from:

* [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/short-interest/)
* [https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AMC.htm](https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AMC.htm)
* [https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest](https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest)
* [https://docoh.com/news/benzinga/19561873/top-30-high-short-interest](https://docoh.com/news/benzinga/19561873/top-30-high-short-interest)

37.7m shares and some quote 79% of float. Clearly a lot of sites are calculating float as 56.1m.

If anyone has any official sources on short interest it'd be great to see. In any case, I'm not advocating that this will be short squeezed. That has nothing to do with my thesis. On 2/25 the Q4 ER is taking place so we'll have a definitive answer on shares outstanding.

**Tickets, sales, customers:**

2019 = 356m consumers

2019 = NYC, LA and Chicago represent 17% of USA total box office. AMC holds 39% market share there.

I don't see any negatives aside from COVID resurging for some reason. I do believe that the very worst is past for the theatre business.

&amp;#x200B;

**Finally, let me address some common comments:**

\- I got Netflix, why would I go to the movies?

You've had netflix for years, yet you (and everyone else) still goes to the movies. The movies are not gonna die anytime soon. Worst case they won't grow and stagnate, but they are here for years to come.

&amp;#x200B;

\- The studios will just offer their movies to streaming and not to theatres.

Absolute bullshit. Theatres are doing the opposite, pulling out catalogs from netflix. They are in a conundrum as they don't really know what to do. They don't want their movies streaming (because it's far, FAAAAAR less revenue for them) through 3rd parties but at the same time cannot create their own platforms to stream. The latter is just stupid. The CAPEX required to build your own platform is high, and the benefit is trivial since they can play movies in theatres and keep the majority of the ticket price. Besides, streaming movies only works for low budget films. Any blockbuster requires the cinematic experience. Very few people have top-model TVs at home with surround sound, and even if they do, 4K streamed over the internet results to sub-par quality. It just does not compare to the cinema quality. The only realistic alternative to cinema for home entertainment is having a top of the line tv+sound+bluray. But that's not streaming is it?

If streaming was to kill off theatres then VHS, DVD and Bluray would have done so before (Studios would have released straight to DVD, why didn't they?). It never happened and for good reason. People go to the movies because of a) The cinematic experience, b) they combine it with a night out, c) it's a way of socializing and much more. That won't go away. Btw, Disney, despite having a streaming platform decided to go ahead with theatrical releases of all its movies in 2021, and won't offer them on streaming at the same time. Get it now?

Another reason why that won't work = Look at Disney, they offered Mulan through their own platform, so what best example to examine. They did not offer it as part of the subscription, so forget about paying your monthly neftlix and having new movies for free. They instead priced it at about 2x movie tickets. Even if they are to continue that with their next releases it's not really that much more affordable compared to going to the movies, is it? So don't expect Universal or 20th Century offering you all their new movies for $10/month. Ain't gonna happen.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Theatres have been open since August but noone is going

Noone is going not only because of COVID concerns, but there are no movies to see. You need studios to release their movies for people to return. I don't expect them to do so until restrictions are lifted and everyone can safely return to the theatres.

&amp;#x200B;

\- So, what else besides James Bond is coming in 2021? why would I go to the cinema for just 1 movie.

You are an idiot. Here is a list of upcoming blockbuster releases: [https://qz.com/1948011/the-2021-movie-calendar-previews-hollywoods-new-normal/](https://qz.com/1948011/the-2021-movie-calendar-previews-hollywoods-new-normal/)

Look at summer time onwards, there is a hot movie almost every week. Most of the movies in the first half will likely be released in the second half after all, making it a bonanza of new films coming out in summer onwards.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Theatres are dead in the long term, aren't they?

We are all dead in the long term. I don't care. Let's focus in the next six months ok? My investment horizon for AMC is up to the end of 2021 the latest. In a best case scenario I expect the recovery to be fully priced in by summer time when I will exit or just start selling CCs again. I may exit/renter several times to what I think may be short-term peaks and troughs. I'm not Buffett so I'm not buying for life. I'm in this for the rally to normalcy.

&amp;#x200B;

\###I may edit this post at the bottom to address any recurring comments. 

\###I'm also planning on buying some calls if IV goes down a bit

\###I won't be doing another AMC DD for a few days at least, maybe after 2/25 when ER happens.

So yeah feel free to keep reading cuz I'm a fucking idiot and you might get a kick out of this.

So. GME. If you're still reading...


BULL CASE, NO SQUEEZE:

if we consider the company's

-cash in hand (i.e. ability to stay afloat)
-sold out pre-orders on the new consoles
-brand awareness (how many of us bought something from GameStop as a child? I bought a LOT of shit from GameStop as a kid and I want my fucking money back so I'm in as I'm sure a lot of others are in for a similar reason)
-constant cost cutting by way of closing down locations which aren't making money
-change of management 
-involvement of Michael Burry (i watched the Big Short and thats all the DD we really need here let's be honest..
-institutional investors holding a signification amount of shares and not selling even after such ridiculous rallies
-GameStop's attempt at pivoting to e-commerce
-Microsoft deal
-rumoured Sony deal
-potential for further deal(s) with more big names
-increasing retail interest
-retail investors looking for the next success story
-premium meme status

I think the stock price (without any sort of squeeze action) will sit around $30 to $50 by the time earnings from the new consoles come into play. This puts the company at a market cap of around $2bn to $3.5bn, respectively - a fairly reasonable valuation compared to previous gaming cycles and taking all aforementioned factors into consideration (and assuming they all go in favour of GME i.e. no bad news, no scandals, no big investors selling off, smashing earnings reports etc, securing further deals).

This valuation MAY be achievable solely based on earnings from new consoles and other products, as well as a successful pivot to e-commerce. However, I personally believe the valuation of $2bn to $3.5bn is contingent on some sort of catalytic news (i.e. more deals with the likes of Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo) carrying the price to the $20 to $25 range PRIOR to the console earnings coming into play. If such a catalyst occurs in time, it may provide the stock with a new floor around $20 to $25 (making the valuation sit at around $1.3bn to roughly $1.6bn) as more retail investors start to take notice.

BULL CASE WITH SQUEEZE: assuming that a short squeeze actually takes place, God only knows where it could end up. I REALLY like that one guy's PT of $500 but that's probably not going to happen. With that being said, I can't even fathom what a short squeeze with 170% short interest could actually do to a stock like this.. Please, someone with ACTUAL knowledge of the market feel free to chime in here. 

So... PT with the turnaround story, securing new deals/partnerships with big companies, increase in retail interest, AND some squeeze action on the side?? $100 to infinity. 


-----


BEAR CASE: the company has been in decline for about 6 years. When we consider WHY the stock is trading so low, one wonders why would it suddenly become worth even $1bn, let alone $2bn to $3.5bn. The rise of e-commerce and now with the ultimate fuck you from the universe (covid) to brick-and-mortar stores.. it's really no wonder why the company is doing so terribly. They may continue to trade at these elevated prices running up to and through the console cycle, but it will not last. This is because making a breakout in the e-commerce sector will be nearly impossible because of Amazon (worldwide), eBay (worldwide) GAME (UK/Europe), and large supermarket chains like Tesco (UK), Asda (UK) and Costco (USA/UK) already having a pretty solid grasp on the market in their respective territories. 

Additionally, as mentioned above, the bull case is contingent on so many factors that it is more likely to continue declining in the mid to long term rather than trending up by any significant measure. Contrary to what a lot of people are thinking, the bear case is actually supported by the ridiculous short interest. Why would so many people be betting against a stock with such passion (170% shorted ffs) if they didn't absolutely believe that they are right and that GME is done for? At least one really solid catalyst WILL be required to push the stock up significantly. It seems that the Microsoft deal was not a significant enough catalyst make the share price moon. So how far up is another deal REALLY likely to push the share price?

Also, If there is no such catalyst until new console earnings come into play, or if big investors start pulling out at ANY point, the stock MAY still spike as console earnings come into play, however, it most likely will not hold above $25 and will crash hard as fuck when people start taking profits/realise what's about to happen.

Also, why would this console cycle affect GME the same way as it previous cycles? We now have so many options to choose from when it comes to buying ANYTHING let alone games or consoles. Of course, Amazon won't be able to fulfil every single order. GameStop WILL pull in hella revenue as demonstrated by the selling out of BOTH waves of PS5 preorders. However, the effect on the share price will not be the same. We will most likely see some huge spikes leading up to/after earnings, but it will be short-lived as people will see that GameStop is one of MANY retailers offering competitive prices for the same items and as supply and demand meet an equilibrium. 

Also.. what do most people do when they can't find something at their go-to store? Most people I know would look at Amazon or eBay rather than waiting it out. This will pull a lot of revenue away from GameStop as other retailors will fill the gaps and reduce the prospects of revenue growth over time. This, in turn, will make the stock price tumble once again, and probably harder than it ever has because this may be GameStop's last shot at turning it around.

Ultimately, I think if any sort of a bear scenario plays out, we could be looking at 52-week low within the next few weeks (I personally don't hold this opinion as I need to keep believing to remain sane).


-----


I could keep talking in circles about why the stock is/isn't gonna moon and who's gonna get fucked the hardest; bears or bulls, respectively. Every reason FOR either side can be easily followed up with an argument AGAINST it.

I would personally really like it if someone could pump the stock so hard that shorts start covering, causing a domino effect of shorts covering their positions (and their asses), leading to ultimate short squeeze so I can finally make a little bit (or a lot) of money. But for all we know, this shit could crash so hard I might never be able to bring myself to trade again.

BULL CASE WITH SQUEEZE: assuming that a short squeeze actually takes place, God only knows where it could end up. I REALLY like that one guy's PT of $500 but that's probably not going to happen. With that being said, I can't even fathom what a short squeeze with 170% short interest could actually do to a stock like this.. Please, someone with ACTUAL knowledge of the market feel free to chime in here. 

So... PT with the turnaround story, securing new deals/partnerships with big companies, increase in retail interest, AND some squeeze action on the side?? $100 to infinity. 


-----


BEAR CASE: the company has been in decline for about 6 years. When we consider WHY the stock is trading so low, one wonders why would it suddenly become worth even $1bn, let alone $2bn to $3.5bn. The rise of e-commerce and now with the ultimate fuck you from the universe (covid) to brick-and-mortar stores.. it's really no wonder why the company is doing so terribly. They may continue to trade at these elevated prices running up to and through the console cycle, but it will not last. This is because making a breakout in the e-commerce sector will be nearly impossible because of Amazon (worldwide), eBay (worldwide) GAME (UK/Europe), and large supermarket chains like Tesco (UK), Asda (UK) and Costco (USA/UK) already having a pretty solid grasp on the market in their respective territories. 

Additionally, as mentioned above, the bull case is contingent on so many factors that it is more likely to continue declining in the mid to long term rather than trending up by any significant measure. Contrary to what a lot of people are thinking, the bear case is actually supported by the ridiculous short interest. Why would so many people be betting against a stock with such passion (170% shorted ffs) if they didn't absolutely believe that they are right and that GME is done for? At least one really solid catalyst WILL be required to push the stock up significantly. It seems that the Microsoft deal was not a significant enough catalyst make the share price moon. So how far up is another deal REALLY likely to push the share price?

Also, If there is no such catalyst until new console earnings come into play, or if big investors start pulling out at ANY point, the stock MAY still spike as console earnings come into play, however, it most likely will not hold above $25 and will crash hard as fuck when people start taking profits/realise what's about to happen.

Also, why would this console cycle affect GME the same way as it previous cycles? We now have so many options to choose from when it comes to buying ANYTHING let alone games or consoles. Of course, Amazon won't be able to fulfil every single order. GameStop WILL pull in hella revenue as demonstrated by the selling out of BOTH waves of PS5 preorders. However, the effect on the share price will not be the same. We will most likely see some huge spikes leading up to/after earnings, but it will be short-lived as people will see that GameStop is one of MANY retailers offering competitive prices for the same items and as supply and demand meet an equilibrium. 

Also.. what do most people do when they can't find something at their go-to store? Most people I know would look at Amazon or eBay rather than waiting it out. This will pull a lot of revenue away from GameStop as other retailors will fill the gaps and reduce the prospects of revenue growth over time. This, in turn, will make the stock price tumble once again, and probably harder than it ever has because this may be GameStop's last shot at turning it around.

Ultimately, I think if any sort of a bear scenario plays out, we could be looking at 52-week low within the next few weeks (I personally don't hold this opinion as I need to keep believing to remain sane).

I could keep talking in circles about why the stock is/isn't gonna moon and who's gonna get fucked the hardest; bears or bulls, respectively. Every reason FOR either side can be easily followed up with an argument AGAINST it.

I would personally really like it if someone could pump the stock so hard that shorts start covering, causing a domino effect of shorts covering their positions (and their asses), leading to ultimate short squeeze so I can finally make a little bit (or a lot) of money. But for all we know, this shit could crash so hard I might never be able to bring myself to trade again.

It's looking like dems will be able to clinch 2 additional senators from the georgia run off e!ection in January. 

While you guys were jerkin yourselves off during e!ection night over biden or trump winning, the hedge funds were watching the senate e!ections, because they knew the only thing that mattered for stonks going up was republicans getting control of the senate again. If the republicans don't get control, then a whole bunch of shit like tax reform can get done and fuck them out of their gainz. 

On e!ection night, stonks mooned when trump was in the lead overnight, and they also mooned again when biden was in the lead. This tells us that the real concern for hedge funds wasn't the president. In fact, stonks started mooning, because the battleground senate races were going in the direction for republicans. This is the reason why stonks went up for trump being in the lead overnight, and then stonks went up even more for when biden was in the lead, because: THE PRESIDENT DOESNT FUCKING MATTER

so where does this leave us. Well, we gotta look at what happens with this runoff e!ection between jon ostrich and David tendie (loughlers a cunt, so she's fucked). 

Ostrich is currently trailing Tendie by around 100k votes, and Shane will most likely support Tendie, because he's worried about the debt (fuckin tard, we're doin WW3 before paying up) so that will put Ostrich another 100k behind.

So, we have to worry about if Ostrich can make up 200k votes. My perspective is that Ostrich can probably do this

From looking at voter registration here:

https://sos.ga.gov/index.php/Elections/voter_registration_statistics

we got about 1.1 million democrats voting in age bracket 18 - 34

it's known that about a 19% increase can be observed in young liberal voter demographics when they recognize shit actually matters. Democrats will be able to capture this, because they can paint the story about how everyone will get more biden bucks if they vote democrat and cuck mcconnell. So that would put Ostrich in the winning position


Therefore, stonks are gonna crash, because that 7% boost from the hedge funds celebrating is probs gonna turn into a 14% crash from the hedge funds dumping their post-celebration shit bags onto you!


what's my position?


1) green new deal and weed stocks for the upside (e.g. ICLN, NIO, ACB, &amp; tsla or the equivalent to tsla like SBE or hyln)

2) boomer investment bank stocks for the downside (e.g. goldman sagging ballsachs)

timeline:

This next week we'll be green because biden actually got confirmed, likely spy will break above resistance by like 2% or some shit. Then it will flag around for the next month, and then it will become apparent to the hedgefunds that the SJW's will have sufficient support for Ostrich to capture the 19%, and then it will drop 3%. On this day is when we should take our positions for the 10% crash to follow, because it will likely coincide with more covid lockdown FUD

Have been seeing a lot of news over the past few days about Valneva (VLA). This is a French company that is just starting phase 3 trials for its vaccine. This is a vaccine made in the classic style - an inactivated virus. With all the other Covid-19 vaccines in the region focused on the virus’s spike protein, the shot could protect against variants that might compromise others, making it the perfect booster.

They expect it to be ready by the end of the year, if trials go well.

They already have a deal with the UK to provide 190million doses. The contract is worth up to $1.7bn - more than 10x the previous years annual revenue.

They are planning a $100million NASDAQ listing very soon.

They also have other vaccines that they are currently working on in a more long term strategy.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously there is a risk that the COVID vaccine they are currently working on does not meet the minimum efficacy rating. But phase 2 trials have shown positive results.

Cleveland Cliffs (CLF) is the largest flat-rolled steel producer in the United States. Their recent acquisitions of assets from ArcelorMittal and AK Steel have allowed them to vertically integrate each step of the process in steel production. From mining raw materials (pellets, metallics, coal/coke) to the steel-making process (stamping, tooling, and tubing) everything is now done in-house.

CLF’s product mix encompasses all things steel, mainly: hot-rolled, stainless &amp; electrical, cold-rolled, coated, plate, and others. They have an industry-leading market share with automotive vehicles, which consist of predominantly trucks/suvs (82% versus 18% sedans). Their total end-market mix consists of:

&amp;#x200B;

* 33% is allocated to auto
* 32% is used in distributors &amp; converters
* 24% is with infrastructure &amp; manufacturing
* 11% in the “other” category.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Market Opportunity**

I’ve read quite a few articles comparing CLF and the steel industry to the average cyclical commodity market, but is that really the case? It’s a fools game to think that steel will have a similar correction as to what lumber prices and many other commodities have recently gone through. I will be the first to admit that the current prices of steel may not be sustainable, but the “steelmageddon” many analysts are expecting may never come. One year ago (August 2020) U.S HRC (Hot-Rolled Coil steel) pricing was at nearly $400. CLF CEO Lourenco Goncalves acknowledged the steel industry may never see those prices again.

The smaller steel-mills that have traditionally undercut prices in an attempt to gain market share have all been buried during covid or bought up by larger companies. Steel is no longer looked at as being a true commodity and demand is very robust. The auto-industry that has recently showed a slow in demand due to microchip shortages will have nowhere to go when demand picks up again, thus steel-suppliers have the upper hand.

The U.S market for steel is roughly $103 billion, but with the upcoming infrastructure bill Cleveland Cliffs is about to reap the benefits of continued tailwinds that by the looks of it will continue until at least the end of 2022. How is this cycle different than the others over the last 20-30 years? A lot has changed for CLF as a company in the last year alone, time will tell what they can do in the next 3-4.

Let’s break-down the market opportunity for the company’s top 3 segments of customers.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Auto (33%): Revenues from the auto-industry are down because car manufacturers have not been producing the same output in 2020 and 2021. Chip shortages have hurt the business, however, pent up demand for new vehicles should be a big driver of revenues as we go into 2022. Keep in mind CLF actually went from over 70% exposure to the car industry to now only 33% with these acquisitions making them less dependent on auto-sales.
2. Distributors &amp; Converters (32%): This market usually represents other steel service centers that purchase steel and fabricate/distribute to their customers’ needs.
3. Infrastructure &amp; Manufacturing (24%): The Biden infrastructure plan should increase steel demand within the United States and the broader initiatives will bolster steel prices.

&amp;#x200B;

**Steel Futures, Contracts, and SPOT Prices**

Steel prices have rocketed in the last 12 months. Here’s a chart of the HRC (hot-rolled coil) steel futures pricing. Note it was $400 last summer in July 2020.

https://preview.redd.it/9fiw3v8fp4g71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc0f3489ac7c35145f6cd4f46e194c56ad78f803

&amp;#x200B;

There are a few things to keep in mind when analyzing a steel company’s contracts to the price of raw materials.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Contracts range from 1-year, quarterly, and spot prices (on demand).
2. The auto-industry usually locks in 1-year contracts for price of steel.

I can’t remember precisely, but Lourenco Goncalves, CLF CEO, noted in the most recent earnings call that the average price they’ve locked in for their contracts is around $1,000, which is lower when comparing to the current spot price of $1,900. However, a lot of the on-demand supply being used for infrastructure contracts is being sold at higher spot prices.

Another thing to look at is demand for the auto-industry in 2021, which was very soft. If they locked companies into contracts at a much lower value in 2021, these contracts will be up for renegotiation soon and they will be able to get a much better price. Bottom line, if steel prices maintain at current levels, which is a possibility as demand has been very robust, CLF will be printing cash on SPOT (on-demand) revenue and lock-in further gains on long-term contract renegotiation.

&amp;#x200B;

**Steel Demand - Catalysts**

Here’s a quick breakdown of what is causing surge in steel prices.

&amp;#x200B;

1. China, who previously exported **15% of the world’s steel supply** has **taken an initiative**, by increasing export taxes, to curb pollution, cap production, and keep more supply within China.
2. The Trump administration created policies that increased taxes on exported steel. Now, the Biden administration will likely keep these policies in place as the “hot” steel industry is primed for creating domestic jobs.
3. Throughout covid steel-production was shrinking alongside demand. With everything re-opening and infrastructure projects in place demand is soaring. There is not enough supply to meet demand and steel futures prices are demonstrating this.
4. Auto-industry rebound. Car-makers have taken a hit with chip shortages and have not been able to produce as many cars as they normally would. We’ve all heard about the boom in the user-car markets due to this shortage. The demand is there and production will rebound in the coming years which should maintain strong production from steel-producers.
5. Steel-mills require large amounts of CapEx which is a huge barrier to entry. It would take years for new competitors to begin producing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Risks**

The biggest risk for steel-producers like CLF is a reversal in steel prices that have more than 300x in 12 months. CLF CEO Lourenco Goncalves was asked on their last earnings call about the cyclical-ness of the industry, and his response was:

&gt;“The other thing is that you need to understand that a lot of what's called commodity in our market is actually highly specified material that cannot be interchangeable. It cannot be just replaced at will, even though that's the perception that is sold to the market… Our timing could not be better. Prime scrap is scarce. And every day the price of scrap goes up, our cost savings from HBI becomes more significant.”

I think this gives a lot of insight into how he views the future pricing of steel as a commodity.

&amp;#x200B;

**CLF - Massive EBITDA Growth**

I want to add a separate section for EBITDA growth the company has undergone, because it is outstanding. Here’s a visual from the CLF investor presentation.

https://preview.redd.it/lp6379xgp4g71.png?width=1766&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48f8c523f5174ead15c92bd22eb02ceb2d4910ac

&amp;#x200B;

From doing $253 million in 2020 to their recently adjusted guidance of $5.5 billion for 2021 the growth is nearly 2,000%.

I think most analysts are expecting a reversion to the mean for steal prices, but every month steel stays at these elevated prices CLF makes an absolute killing in cash flow. If demand stays as robust as it’s been it looks like CLF might be able to rake in $6 billion EBITDA in 2022, in addition to their 5.5 billion guidance in 2021. Keep in mind these expectations are even surprising management. The company raised guidance in Q1 2021 and again recently on the Q2 2021 earnings report.

After a record quarter, the CEO also commented about how the next quarter will again break records.

&gt;“This being said, our Q2 record numbers: revenue of 5 billion; net income of 795 million; and adjusted EBITDA of 1.4 billion, should not be our all-time records for long… With the lagged and fixed pricing mechanisms we have in place with our customers, we have enough visibility to be confident that these records should be broken again here in the third quarter.”

LG was asked why he thinks CLF’s stock price is still under-valued. As with most companies that deal with commodities (due to how cyclical they are) analysts are short-sighted and can only see what the company is bringing in this quarter… The quote “A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush” comes to mind. However, based on what LG is saying, it sounds like the company will have cash flow like they’ve never seen coming in. He says: 

&gt;“But when I realized that the market is skeptical about a lot of things, that I know that the market is wrong, and I know about the cash flow that's coming, the $1.4 billion in cash coming in Q3 is real, the way our pricing structure is construed as well as the Q4 another, 1.8 billion.”

Lourenco’s main objective is to completely clear the balance sheet of all long-term debt. He’s stated multiple times that by 2022 they can expect to be debt-free. Every dollar they pay down on debt goes to equity and expands CLF’s enterprise value. By this time next year it is quite possible CLF is completely debt-free and printing cash. Excess cash can be used for strategic investments and potentially a share-buyback or dividend, which LG has hinted at before. I see two outcomes, the first is if CLF’s share price is so cheap they may authorize a buy-back of a good chunk FCF.

Let’s say the share price is at $25 this time next year and they authorize $2 billion (two quarters of FCF) in a share re-purchase program. 2 billion dollars equates to roughly 80 million shares. With a float of 450 million shares that’s nearly 18% of the float (!).

On the other hand if the shares appreciate by a large amount the dividend will be quite nice. Lourenco has said many times he thinks the current share price is extremely under-valued. My opinion is that he will do what he can to pump the stock.

&amp;#x200B;

**Valuation &amp; Fundamentals**

I’m going to compare CLF to 3 of it’s competitors. X, Nucor (NUE), and Steel Dynamics (STLD).

https://preview.redd.it/p7vjjt7ip4g71.png?width=1276&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=859b613f8ffe8fcafa309a8f47dcb90d6039bc23

&amp;#x200B;

At first glance their financials look very similar and you might even say that currently they are all somewhat fairly valued. However, this is based off CLF’s trailing twelve month (TTM) revenues of $12.9 billion while we are expecting that to more than double in 2022. In Q2 2021, CLF management made a clear point in emphasizing that their top-line revenue grew by over a billion that quarter, while their cost of goods sold grew by only $100 million. A huge increase in gross margin which was made capable by their strategic acquisitions and vertical integrations. Don't forget their goal by this time next year is to have zero debt.

&amp;#x200B;

**Final Thoughts**

In my opinion, the extreme growth CLF has seen in revenues and EBITDA and the transformation of the company as whole justifies the stock price at current date. However, when I look into the future and 1-2 years down the road, I very much agree with the CEO in the fact that there is much upside to be seen, with little downside.

I like the fact that the CEO is eager to get the stock price up. I like that the company is looking to completely rid debt from the balance sheet. I like that in 2022 they will have excess cash for more acquisitions or potentially a dividend/buyback. All good signs of a healthy company that has benefited from somewhat of an unexpected boom in steel prices.

The TLDR; version of Vito's DD is: **Steel demand is VERY high and supply is VERY low.** Go and read the DD as the guy has worked in the industry for a long time and clearly knows what he is talking about. 

Now I ain't no fucking economist, I'm just a wall street autist, but I do know that there's a supply and demand economic law. Take a look at the graph below, friend.

So now that I refreshed your memory about supply and demand, let's go back in time.

It's 2008, steel is at an all time high. How high? Well the highest exporter of steel in the world as of 2019 $MT reached a wooping $245.53 on 6th of July 2008 before plumetting harder than $SPCE today because supply finally caught up with the demand. 

Now I know you have many quesitons.. Why the fuck was it so high, yet today it's trading at $20?  
Why does my wife hate me? What happened in 2008???

Go read this article or just read the TLDR. But notice that this article was written in FEBRUARY 2008, 4 MONTHS BEFORE $MT reached an all time high of $250-ish..

TLDR; 

\-Demand for steel remains high, although the Western economies just collapsed.  
\-Coal prices SOAR. Coal is one of the main ingredients in steel production.   
\-Exports from China fall, causing steel prices to MOON in Europe.  
\-Experts predict steel price will continue to rise.

Rememeber the points above as we return to today.

So what's the situation right now? Vito summed it up best in his post ""There is not relief in sight and many steel mills are having to purchase raw materials - iron ore and scrap at prices not seen since 2008.""

Shoutout to [SteveMcHeave](https://www.reddit.com/user/SteveMcHeave/) for linking me to the [trading economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/steel-production) page where you can view each countries output of steel by month. If you Google ""top 10 producers of steel"", then view each countries steel production month by month, you will see that all major producers of steel are still at pre-covid levels of production except for China.

Steel mills are just starting back up and will probably reach pre-covid levels by end of year. I'm sure these mills have quite a few orders backloged because covid caused logistical issues. Suppliers couldn't deliver goods as countries shut their borders, local outbreaks at factories forced people to self isolate, etc, etc. And to add more fuel to the fire of DEMAND, vaccine news will allow world economies to start pumping again. Projects that are due to start in 2021 will begin and so will the demand for steel.

Okay one final thing.. COAL. Remember in 2008 how the price of coal soared by 65%?

Read [this article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-10/iron-ore-futures-top-150-as-china-demand-fuels-late-year-surge)  TLDR;  
\-$Vale lowers its target for iron delivery due to the dam disaster it had earlier. Vale is the second largest importer of iron to China.  
\-Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley say coal prices will continue to be higher than usual into next year.  
\-Australias bank says ""If you chill the fuck out, mate, and reduce your steel production, coal will go back to normal prices"". Probably won't happen as demand in west is starting to increase  
\-Australias bad weather is causing supply issues.

Now you will probably go and do some more DD and see that China's steel mills have recently asked their governing bodies to investigate the price of coal coming in from Australia. I don't think this will have much of an impact on coal because the demand is high and the supply is dropping, prices are bound to increase. China started a trade war with Australia and banned a load of Australian imports, so things will only get more interesting from here. 

As long as the supply is behind the demand the price of steel will continue to rise. As price of steel continues to rise, so will the profits of the steel producers. God speed to you and I shall see you in tendy town.

Steel price will rise as supply tries to catch up with the demand. The original DD who inspired this post thinks $MT will rise signlificantly over the next 8-12 weeks.

1. Buy $MT / Arcelor Mittal as they are the biggest supplier of steel in the world as of 2019
2. Buy Schnitzer Steel
3. Buy $Vale

Read [this article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-10/iron-ore-futures-top-150-as-china-demand-fuels-late-year-surge)  TLDR;  
\-$Vale lowers its target for iron delivery due to the dam disaster it had earlier. Vale is the second largest importer of iron to China.  
\-Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley say coal prices will continue to be higher than usual into next year.  
\-Australias bank says ""If you chill the fuck out, mate, and reduce your steel production, coal will go back to normal prices"". Probably won't happen as demand in west is starting to increase  
\-Australias bad weather is causing supply issues.

Now you will probably go and do some more DD and see that China's steel mills have recently asked their governing bodies to investigate the price of coal coming in from Australia. I don't think this will have much of an impact on coal because the demand is high and the supply is dropping, prices are bound to increase. China started a trade war with Australia and banned a load of Australian imports, so things will only get more interesting from here. 

As long as the supply is behind the demand the price of steel will continue to rise. As price of steel continues to rise, so will the profits of the steel producers. God speed to you and I shall see you in tendy town.

**TLDR;**

[READ THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kcqkax/steel_stocks_getting_ready_for_lift_off/?sort=new)   
Steel price will rise as supply tries to catch up with the demand. The original DD who inspired this post thinks $MT will rise signlificantly over the next 8-12 weeks.

1. Buy $MT / Arcelor Mittal as they are the biggest supplier of steel in the world as of 2019
2. Buy Schnitzer Steel
3. Buy $Vale 

Personally I'm all in on $MT. This shit could hit $60 by next year.",STEEL STALLIONS UNITE Hello good autist friend hope well After seeing Godfather Vito post DD steel I started hyperventilating The TLDR version Vito DD Steel
